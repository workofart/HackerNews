I have been doing Avid tech support for over 10 years (Avid is the industry standard software for editing video/film - although that is being threatened strongly) I have been waiting for this to happen. Was wondering when someone would jump on the idea of providing in-browser editing tools for the &#34;YouTube&#34; crowd. Avid's a fool not to embrace this... Anyway, I want to jump in soon with the whole video on the web experience. I hope to update everyone soon over time on what my ideas are... Hope all are well and good luck!",

It is by far one of my favorite web tools, and I think one of the most useful things about it is the way that it encourages a sort of conversation between its users (ie, someone can send a bookmrak to me, which of itself, begins a sort of dialogue between us, or can write a description in the notes taht I know is intended for me). What I find disappointing sometimes is that when this happens there is no way for me respond to them directly about the link (you can send messages to another user, but then you lose a lot of the context). The most obvious answer would be to allow me to comment on other users' bookmarks or \"send\" them a message back about the bookmark they sent me. The explanation I keep getting when I say this is that they didn't want to distract users or muddy the purpose of the app by turning it into another blogging tool. Ultimately, I think they made the right choice not to add this feature. It keeps it clean and useful while still allowing for self expression within the core of the application. I would probably like Digg a lot more if I weren't so damned distracted by all of the threaded comments that follow each post, most of which are completely useless.",

In my experience, one of the largest hurdles to user adoption is getting something useful from the site.  If a user is able to see the value of the service *before* putting something into it, they are more likely to understand the offering and accepting the reward for 5 minutes worth of forms.  There are so many services competing for users attention and everyone of them are fighting for their niche.  You have to put something on the table to gain the initial interest to keep the user on a site long enough to make it past the click of the back button.

I think a lot of students are getting discouraged from the computer science field because they don't want to be pre-Matrix Neo or stuck in the daily grind from Office Space. <p>You definitely can end up in that situation but if you're smart and passionate, you won't. Being a developer in a startup is an example of that. If you love what you're working on and you're contributing to its potential, you're not going to be that monkey. <p>Or if there's nothing already out there where you can apply this passion, take the entrepreneurial route. That's likely why we're all here on this site to begin with. :)",

It&#39;s owned by the Autonomy group, where, according to the article, the founder of this company used to work. <p>There&#39;s also Podzinger, a subsidary of BBN, which is another company that gets a lot of gov business.  Podzinger runs BBN&#39;s speech recognition system on podcasts and videos, and pipes the output to a search engine:  &#60;http://podzinger.com/&#62;.  <p>I could go on...  And if people are interested, I&#39;d be happy to post links to some relevant papers and tools.<p>To my mind 2 interesting things are going on here.  1) The company appears to be thriving by applying 20 year-old stuff from the lab to a new problem, in apparently no special way.  (And that&#39;s not a bad thing!)  2) They got an article in the NYT business section to talk about Hidden Markov Models.  Although maybe that&#39;s not so surprising, since hedge funds have recently started speaking out about using machine learning.",

They&#39;ve won the war as far as universities are concerned.  However, universities generally do the job of teaching very well.  You also don&#39;t hear of fatal university shootings often (If ever?  I haven&#39;t looked.)  I&#39;m in it to improve the lives and education of high school students.  If I manage to better just one student&#39;s life, then I&#39;ll consider it mission accomplished.<p>High schools are very much open game.  They&#39;re open game because they can&#39;t typically afford the huge sums of money that universities can.  I plan to dominate the low end by creating a product that&#39;s simple, efficient, and inexpensive; something that every teacher would want.  I&#39;m not competing with Blackboard.  I&#39;m sidestepping them.<p>I agree that teachers have methods that they&#39;ve employed for years to teach students.  But part of that is exactly the problem.  When something is done exactly the same for years on end, it gets stale.  A teacher would have -fun- with my product, exploring other&#39;s ideas and communities.  I plan to make them happy.<p>They may be reluctant to use my product, but I plan to be with my two cofounders, on foot, visiting local high schools as soon as I have a feature set that&#39;s useful, and spending time with individual teachers to show them how they might benefit from it.  Then it&#39;s up to the teachers whether or not they&#39;ll use Classbug, but if I&#39;ve done my job well, they&#39;ll most certainly want to.<p>Shawn",

                "text": "I&#39;m not convinced there is much use for this. And there are two fundamental problems.<p>The first problem is the institutional structure of the US education system. In my experience, tech-savvy instructors rarely look for a generic CMS solution. And those without much tech experience resist change unless it is forced upon them because they are already good at what they do and change disrupts their ability to get their jobs done. Blackboard gets around this inertia by selling to university and school administrations, which then push the technology out throughout campuses. It is a top-down sales regime. The company has non-compete clauses so that instructors cannot adopt other systems even if they wanted to. Competing with Blackboard on their own terms would mean wining and dining a lot of administrators who are not going to be interested in beta-testing software.<p>The second problem is more fundamental. A lot of the really interesting stuff happening in the education field is happening with interest based communities like Chinesepod or even open source software projects (for an education in programming...). There are two things that are common to both sorts of communities: #1 they are interest driven, #2 the materials produced are not attempts to solve specific institutional needs so much as address individual &#34;learner&#34; problems. <p>A project like this should be very clear about whether it is serving institutional or learner needs. If you don&#39;t know exactly how to help students, what is the point of creating a system simply to automate stuff?",

The product peep was in charge of making sure everything was done in favour of the user/customer. Great approach.<p>2) &#34;The product progression here is worth pointing out. MyBlogLog started with a product that delivered value to users without requiring network effects to be in place first. The social product would not have worked as effectively upon launch without it being pre-populated by profiles.&#34; - Network effects are tricky to get started. Build something you can use stand alone too. Like flickr. Many used flickr because it was a better photo organiser than what they had on their PCs and it was better than emailing pictures. Only later did the community come into play.",

There is plenty of proof online regarding the type of conversion returns that firms are getting and the revenue publishers are generating.

Even now, most tech savvy people are so used to the omnipresent nature of goole ads that they ignore them by nature.  I can&#39;t even remember the last time I clicked on a google ad or any ad for that matter!  If we add real means to block ads (mozilla add ons for example) to this subconcious rejection of advertising one can see that, in at most a generation, the viability of ad based businesses will be tenuous at best.  <p>Take the example of the Sprint ad which featured 3 guys dancing in the office.  A majority of us watched, a majority probably even liked the ad, but I&#39;ll bet very few switched over.  As technology and information become more pervasive, it&#39;s going to be harder and harder to sell a bad or second class product no matter how good your marketing team is.  Better to spend those precious dollars on designing a top notch product and let the consumers be your advertisers.",

Easy database migrations.<p>2.) The :AsTree and related specifiers in ActiveRecord that automatically creates utility methods for the object model (such as searching over parents/children of a record)<p>3.) Easy handling of session data<p>I haven't found any mention of these features in either Django or TurboGears and I haven't snooped enough yet to find them.

We have been using Rails for about a year now, and really enjoyed it from the very start because it did so much for us.  Well we have prototyped the idea and would like to start building it for real, and we kept getting caught by Rails when we tried to go against the grain.<p>So we started to look into other web application frameworks, and turned up a lot of comparison between two python-based frameworks, Django and Turbogears, with Rails.  Although they were all very outdated, they all boiled down to using a python-based framework if you want more of the internals exposed (because you have include a lot more code to explicitly specify what you want to do), and use Rails if you don't want these details exposed.  To be fair, you can always dive into the rails code itself to look at the internals, so it is more of a question of how you want your application code to look.<p>As I don't have too much Turbogears experience at this point, I would gladly welcome a re-analysis of the comparison from someone who does.    And I hope that just by posting the link to the Turbogears tutorial video that someone realizes there are more webb application frameworks out there besides Rails.",

Good early feedback, much appreciated. <p>I'm building CrowdVine because I want to see social networks treated as first class social media applications, joining blogs, wikis, and pod/video-casts. <p>In response to the nothing to do but read blogs comment, in a niche social network the people are the content. Connecting to them and finding ways to build an identity within the community are the main activities. If you're applying social networks in way that ties in with people's identity then you can have a lot of socializing without a lot of features. If you're (mis)applying a social network to a topic that has nothing to do with people's identity then you're going to have to build in a lot of other activities.<p>I think it's a big boon that Ning decided to focus just for the fact that it helps define the market. They obviously have an amazing team. It'll be interesting to see if they stay with the social-networks-for-everyone market given that they're already doing deals for bigger networks (for CBS), neither of their founders actually uses the software to run a social network, and that they're already 27 people big and 9 million in the hole. \n",

Instead of bidding on $x/click, someone who signed up for Checkout could instead sign up and bid on $x or y% per sale, effectively eliminating fraudulant clicks. <p>I guess the trouble with this is that you'd still be able to send a truckload of traffic at a competitor to decrease the Google cut per visitor. But it would totally eliminate people  artifically increasing their Adsense clicks, and if they optimised for the Google income per Adsense view on a site by site basis, then the long tail would effectively be safe from people trying to decrease the rank of their competitors. Not to mention that the data from the long tail would give you an excellent idea of who is being hurt by artifical traffic (you could even use the data from the long tail to rank the main Google search ads which would eliminate the problem entirely, perhaps at the risk of a bit of inaccuracy).",

The prediction market was set up in August 2004, and the product that \"had been in the works for a long time\" was scheduled to ship in November 2004. <p>Each \"trader\" received $50 in their account to start with, and was told that the more accurate their prediction, the more money they would make. The market opened with an initial price of on-time delivery set to 16 2/3 cents.<p>\"The price of 'before November' dropped to zero right away,\" Proebsting said. \"The price of 'on time' in about two to three minutes dropped to 2.3 cents on the dollar.\" Translated, that's more than 30-to-1 odds against on-time delivery.<p>Then the woman who was responsible for scheduling started trying to convince her colleagues who were buying and selling future delivery dates. \"She was able to talk (on-time delivery) up to around 3 cents,\" Proebsting said. \"People really enjoyed moving the price...They loved this.\"<p>\"The next day the director comes into my office and said, 'What have you done?'\" Proebsting said. But further investigation showed that the product actually was behind schedule, even though nobody was telling management, and it eventually shipped in February.\"<p>It is amazing what the crowds are capable of! Often times, groups can be smarter than the smartest individuals in them.",

My hope is that the major parts vendors will recognize that Octopart is a good thing for them, and will play ball--both on the technical/database integration front, and, hopefully in terms of monetizing the product.  Because it really is a great product.<p>One technical quibble, though:  Octopart could improve its result quality a good bit by incorporating some semantic analysis.  An example:  a search for \"blue led 3mm leaded\" returns as its first result an SMD (i.e. non-leaded) part.  What's going on here?  It's matching the phrase \"Leaded Process Compatible: No;\" with a bit of not-terribly-deep semantic matching (leveraging the fact that part specs speak a relatively contrived and regularized language) it should be possible to recognize that \"Leaded Process Compatible: No\" is not a match for leaded.<p>Quibbles aside, I'm looking forward to watching Octopart improve, and, hopefully, succeed.

Finding a cofounder is more a meeting of minds and interests - the ideas one has and are passionate about can be modified accordingly.<p>Every entrepreneur isn't short of ideas - but every entrepreneur in his/her social circle is a maverick of one sort or another. SO if the local concentration of mavericks isn't high it makes things difficult. Finding a cofounder is pretty hard and only something that can be done by finding someone you agree with - then trying out the relationship over a project.<p>I met my cofounder accidently - last year i had an idea and approached a couple of people cold and just tried doing a project. One of the guys i met i seemed to work with amazingly well. We sparked ideas, started creating other side projects, had complementary skills, believed in beautiful design and how simple ideas could really impact the world and above all we had the same positive attitude and stamina to make things happen (we both have great stamina and a get things done attitude). Our ideas have changed from the original one. A year later we've worked on so many things - but most importantly we can depend on eachother to make things happen. <p>Bottom line, cofounders pop up in unexpected places. Be open, talk to people you know, friends, their friends - see if anyone sparks. Its a hard road until then - but trial people out - get them involved in your project. Hidden mavericks do exist in local environments and passion is infectious. \n",

Theoretically, MySpace should know a massive amount of information about each user (everything they list on their profile page), including location, age, interests, media consumption patterns, etc.  They could be selling very highly-targeted ads based on all of those parameters.  Wouldn't it be more lucrative NOT to sell a graphical ad on the homepage at a daily rate of $250,000 (as the post reports), but instead to make the homepage ad dynamically tailored to each user?  ",

I was disappointed right at the beginning that he combined study and practice into one concept called practice and then pretty much all of his drills were about studying.  The truth is I think most programmers, especially good ones, are self-made, which implies also that they most certainly know how to step outside of their comfort zone and study- sometimes compulsively.<p>On the other hand, you really don't see a lot of programmers who practice (the real definition, not Steve's)- and I was excited that he was going to write about something I've been thinking a lot about but he never did.<p>Here's a real example of programming practice- establish a baseline and then repeat the coding exercise from scratch until you feel like you could code it with your eyes closed.  Like that FizzBuzz program from the post a few days back that a bunch of us spontaneously coded- erase what you did and code it again.  Figure out how to write it in lisp, then erase your code, time yourself, code it again.<p>If it sounds silly, actually try it- you really do gain something.  Time yourself going through the vim tutorial (if you're not already a master)- do every single example 2x- and try to beat your time later.  That's real practice, rarely practiced.",

Useful explains itself (though it's often forgotten); necessary is the real Occam's razor of the group, and perhaps the important one for start-ups (i.e. during the initial angel phase, get your critical functionality implemented--a VC won't be impressed by great features if the core functionality doesn't work); beautiful is tricky.  It's aesthetic.  When it comes to code, though, beauty is usually directly related to maintainability and extensibility.  Sure, beauty is in the eye of the beholder, and what I think is atrocious C++ might be beautiful to you, and my beautiful Lisp might make you cry; what matters is that the code is beautiful to the person who has to interact with it.",

Here is a nice dissection of ads I did for another site cluttered with them: <p>http://shuzak.com/img/Temporary/SpammingUsers.jpg (The ads are highlighted in green)<p>An excerpt from an article I wrote on user experience that seems relevant here:<p>\"One thing I particularly dislike about Web 2.0 startups is their Web 1.0 approach towards displaying advertisements. It shouldn't take an Einstein to realize where Google ads are appropriate and where they are not...Note that there is nothing wrong with displaying ads as long as it makes sense to do so. If you have no ads on your site, you will not make money off of it. If you have too many ads on your site, nobody is going to click on them.<p>It is unfortunate that nearly every social network spam's their own users with unwanted ads. The users are less likely to notice advertisements as the frequency of ads increases within a site. Even worse, because the users are so used to seeing ads popup, they might ignore them even when they do make sense [6]. Usability should always be prioritized over revenues. When a user chooses to spend 20 minutes of their life on your website, they could be spending that time anywhere else, but they chose your site. Don't reward their loyalty with spam [7].\"",

Sounds like Arc is working out well.<p>Still, though, any statstical approach (which is what I assume you're using) is going to have some lag because you have to wait for a statistically-significant sample.

They tend to spend more time reading the \"new\" queue than average, because they spend enough time on the site to exhaust \"top\" and want to read more.<p>2. They're more likely than average to be open-minded about controversial stories as well as less tolerant of inane ones.  If they spend more time on the site, then it's more to their advantage to promote interesting stuff rather than promote an agenda.  It's dumb to piss in your own pond.<p>Here's what I propose: high-karma users get more voting power over *young* stories, to enable them to police the \"new\" queue and out-muscle spammers and voting rings.  After stories are a few hours old, high-karma users no longer get a boost if they haven't voted on them yet.  If high-karma users have already voted on a story when it reaches the aging threshold, the boost goes away for upvotes but not for downvotes.  That way: <p>1. Bad stories never see the light of day, because high-karma users bury them and they stay buried.<p>2. Controversial stories will make the front page, but they don't stay there long if the rest of the community doesn't like them.<p>3. Good stories make it to the front page slightly faster.",

Apple announces the iPhone, Microsoft criticizes it then announces their phone. Now Google Apps. Man, Microsoft needs to grow up and find out what people want before Google takes them to task with Apps.\"",

If it takes off, it will be not so much a useful product in itself, but an enabling technology for an entirely new class of products.  Imagine the possibilities that arise from having a relatively complete, constantly evolving ontology of everything.  All of those nifty tricks that computational linguists and proof theoreticians can do over finite domains, using very limited ontologies, become possible for all sorts of other applications.  Armed with an ontology that closely matches the real world, it is finally possible to write code that can reason about the real world, rather than just throw Bayes law at it and hope something useful falls out.",

We've had a small investor gives us some seed money, which could last us for about a year. We both have our personal laptops to develop it. I use a 17\" Acer, my partner has a 13\" Macbook. He sometimes uses an extra screen, property of another company at our shared office, a 20\". This ofcourse saves him a lot of stress and lets him develop somewhat faster.<p>We'd like to buy him an extra screen of course, but is this really fitting for a small start-up that isn't earning money yet? We've got the budget, but should it be tapped into? And of course: who pays for this thing? Should we just order it through our company and forget about it, or do we hold it in on my partners (very modest) salary? <p>This all has to do with your personal guidelines and budget, but what do you guys think? Buy the thing and be done with it, or be more thoughtful of what you spend in such an early stage?",

In fact, I already have half that amount sitting in my bank account (student fees, :p). Our reason for applying to YC is to have the opportunity to create something larger than us (apologies for the cliche). There is no better place to do it than through Y Combinator. YC works at the same wavelength as its hackers; that is a considerable difference between a VC and Y Combinator.<p>If you were an aspiring hip/hop musician, would you rather go to Shady Records for a record label or Donald Trump?",

                "text": "This is an interesting question, and as a girl geek who is applying to y combinator and has worked for many startups, I can mention a few things. <p>1) Startup culture appears to be a boys' club.  <p>a) Have you ever noticed that when you hire the first woman in any company, the dynamic changes? There's resistance to that change, whether it's for better or worse. (pun intended) There's a big sign on your clubhouse that says [GIRLZ KEEP OUT!] Sometimes it's very subtle. Sometimes overt. How many of you actually had women on the short list of people you were choosing to partner with? Some geeky guys still have a hard time talking with girls. It may be an issue with whom you're comfortable sharing your great idea. From what I've read in these posts, you have some assumptions that you're making about girls. Truth is, when you get to a certain level of skill or creativity, assumptions need to fly out the window - for both men and women. <p> b) With that being said, I love it when work consumes me with a passion and takes all of my time to the exclusion of all else. I have mad skills in a bunch of different areas and startups seem to want me. . . but they don't think of me as a co-founder. I code, design, do market research, marketing strategy, media buys, infrastructure, pitches. . .  basically I've worked for many startups doing everything necessary to get started. Still thought of as an accessory - never fully included. My solution to this has been to position myself differently - and I can do that now. I need to market my skills differently from the way guys do. This has been successful. <p>2) We're not as sensitive to hierarchies and heirarchies' flip side, competition, as guys are. <p>a) We often just want to get it done. We don't care as much if it strokes our ego or your ego. It needs to be done. If, every time we have a conversation, it becomes a zero sum game of who wins the dominance, it's stupid. <p>If there's a list of things that need to get done on the table, and some tasks are seen as too onerous for guys' job descriptions (egos), we wind up doing it because it needs to get done. Because we did it, somehow our status falls. We wind up getting stuck with _all_ the crappy jobs, and it winds up sucking for us as our status continually sinks. <p>b) We assess ourselves and our skills differently. Here's an illustrative example. A female engineer once told me why she gave up working in industry. She was the only woman working with a team of guys. The team lead would throw out a task for discussion on the table. Everyone but she would say they could do it easily. She would say that no, this has these challenges and would take much longer. One of the guys who said that it was easy would get the project and then go to her for help doing the problematic tasks. Who got promoted? The guy. Who was doing all the hard work? She was. Female examiners at the patent office tell the same story. There are a lot of women engineers who leave industry because they can assess themselves and the problems accurately and this isn't valued. Managers want their problems solved. They value gung-ho over truth.<p>c) This is often linguistic. Men and women use different syntax to express the same thoughts. I need to remap what makes sense to me onto another linguistic pattern and that seems to be a waste of energy. In fact, this has a lot of benefit because it makes us better communicators all around. It's a learning curve - and it's often hard to recognize that it's there or needed. (I was a linguistics geek in college, where I found out that 85% of all conversational interruptions occur men on women, so it's a challenge for us to get a complete paragraph size thought into a conversation - much less complete a sentence without being completely stepped on.) <p>But even in the more egalitarian parts of the States, there are different linguistic patterns for men and women. If you go to the South, it's much more amplified. If a woman makes a statement with the same intonation and wording as a guy, the conversation just stops for a hot minute while everyone in the room processes it. In places like Alabama, I need to preprocess so that the communication is seamless and the conversational stoppages don't occur - and this often means using what would be considered subservient speech, like ending a statement with a questionmark. Up north, if I'm in a roomful of guys, or even just talking with one, the preprocessing still needs to happen. <p>        d) It may be that because we're not as sensitive to hierarchies and have different sensibilities about status, money means something fundamentally different to us. <p>        e) When I was in college, I really wanted to go into physics, and I was good at it. I spent a summer working for NASA and saw how cutthroat the competition was among the physics geeks and didn't like it. Several years later, I was the webmaster for a hearing research center at a big university. It was a collection of twenty or so labs. I noticed that there were a lot of female scientists, that there was a lot of collaboration between scientists in this particular center and also around the world. I decided to find out what was so different and spent about a year asking people how it came about. <p>The story is interesting. It wasn't by accident. It turns out that at MIT thirty years ago, there was a hearing research professor who got all of his grad students together and told them that their careers didn't have to be all sniping and competitive - that they could do something different and agree to cooperate. These grad students are now the heads of their own departments. They teach their undergrad and grad students what behavior is acceptable and are growing a culture of deep respect and cooperation. It has a lot of benefits for hearing research as a whole. Work isn't hidden from each other and duplicated - meaning money and time isn't wasted - so it's much better for the hearing research discipline. There isn't the attitude of hoarding ideas for credit. Everyone's resum\u00e9 has long lists of collaborations. Mostly, everyone's really happy and nice. Apparently, vision research is the exact polar opposite. <p>I know that in a free market society, competition is seen as creating efficiency, but in a lot of ways, it's very wasteful because of hoarding of ideas and duplication of effort. For people who don't have access to resources, cooperation results in significantly greater value. There isn't nearly as much money available for hearing research, but these researchers are incredibly efficient because they eliminated the competition from the discipline. They're still evaluated. They still have to do their work and be very good at it. It's just that the element of fear is gone. <p>Alpha males and alpha females see competition differently. How many alpha males can be in a company at any one time? Those who aren't the tiny percent of you who are alpha males feel fear when there's excessive competition. Do you want to work in a fearful environment?<p>    3) If we're single and cute, the dominant chimp will hit on us unless he has a well developed sense of morals. I've been around and around with this one with other women about what to do in response to this and have seen a lot of different strategies to handle it. Some women just shut down their levels of expression and passion for their work. (sucky solution) I know one woman who pretended she was a lesbian. (sucky solution, but one of the most successful - she still retained respect) This comes up a lot at female executive dinners. It's tiresome because when the dominant chimp's ego's bruised there's _always_ retaliation of some form. <p>4) It may be that y combinator and the VC game doesn't get us where we want to be. <p>a) If the majority of all small businesses in the States are being started by women, and if we're especially good at communication and customer service, which you'd think would be great for Web 2.0, then what is it about the whole VC game that doesn't get us there? How are we starting our businesses without you? When we're starting businesses, what's the structure like? What kinds of businesses are they? <p>b) I know that usually VCs or angels don't even look at people until they've spent $50k of their own money. Women have a harder time coming up with funds like that. We still don't have wage parity. We're taking care of our parents or our sister's kids. It's harder for us to get out of family obligations. In the family, daughters are still thought of differently. While I was still an undergrad, I was a founder in a startup. I had to leave to take care of my sick mother. When I asked her if I were a guy, would she have asked me to give up my business, she replied, \"no.\" without any hesitation. We're still expected to do the bulk of non-market labor in this culture. If we say no, there are repercussions. Being a good girl is always for someone else's convenience. <p>c) It may be a timing thing. Women may have different goals immediately after college. It would be interesting to check to see how old the women are who are starting businesses in this country. I'd want to check the distribution graph - don't just look at the mean or median ages of when they're starting businesses - I bet there are several humps on it - each would tell a different story about that group's lives. By excluding women who are above a certain age, you're cutting out a lot of experience and wisdom. One of the coolest businesses was started by Mary Kay. However cheezy her pink Caddies are, she had a lot of insight into how women ran their lives and built her cosmetics distribution model on those insights.<p>d) I'm willing to bet that women are starting businesses with less, are entering businesses with lower barriers to entry in general, and that the geeky women aren't starting businesses or aren't going your route to do it. If you look at the percentage of female college grads in engineering and the sciences, it's a much higher percentage than who are applying to y combinator. How are their opportunities and thoughts different? Perhaps you should ask them. You're missing a lot of talent by not addressing it. Are there qualities that you are rewarding that talented women find reprehensible or icky?<p>By definition, you're looking for special people. The next Teslas are going to be odd no matter where they're from or what their gender is. What would have happened to Tesla if there had been no viciousness of Edison's smear campaigns? Clearly the world lost out. (I have a thing for Tesla, and in an ideal world, Firefly would still be on the air.) <p>If the next Tesla is currently wearing a burka in Afghanistan, she, and the world, are out of luck. If she's in school just down the river, or has just sent her kids off to college, you may be able to do something about it if you want to. ",

If you really meant to say that their potential hasn't been realized, then is it possible that expectation levels were too high to begin with? Same thing with higher level programming languages. How long have people been working on ML, Haskell, LISP, etc? What you really mean is natural language programming languages, like English, Chinese, etc. as programming languages.<p>The flip side is that some problems that were thought to be easy to solve may, in fact, be unsolvable (practically or theoretically). Computer vision is a good example of this. <p>I'm not trying to start a war or play devil's advocate for the sake of playing. My comments come from a real place. I have a PhD in computer science and was a professor in the field at a top university in the US. As sobering as it is to think about, I have serious concerns about CS  because the problem landscape looks a little flat. The first mountain was computation (e.g., microprocessors), then usability, then networking/communications. What's next? I believe a big breakthrough in established fields like AI, VR, etc. are low probability using existing computational models, the weak proof being that a lot of very bright people have been working on these hard problems for a very long time and advances appear to be small and incremental. I don't know if QC will hold any promises in this area, maybe so.",

And I thought your \"Unified Theory of VC suckage\" mentioned this too, though rereading it, it seems more about how VCs take winners startups and make them fail rather than how winners avoid the VCs to start with.<p>That said, my high school math teacher and first employer was an angel investor, and he said his success rate was *well* under 10%.<p>A lot also depends on your definition of failure.  When Ludicorp shut down Game Neverending and launched Flickr, would that count as a failure?  If they had taken millions in VC funding, would they have been able to shut down GNE and say \"We're going to build a photo-IM client\"?  I'm currently working for a (profitable) startup with 4 products.  Only one of them is generating any revenue.  If that had been VC-funded, it likely would have been 4 separate companies, 3 of which were failures.",

For entrepreneurs with a previous failure it was 20%, and for entrepreneurs with a previous success it was 33%.<p>I suspect that the success rate is somewhat higher for bootstrapped tech startups, because you're given the option of failing and trying again with the same company, different idea.  Usually if you fail with a VC's money, they liquidate the company.  If you fail with your own, you can take the assets you have and try to redirect them to a new line of business.<p>I thought I saw another study somewhere that said that the average number of failures a bootstrapped startup goes through is 4.  That squares with the success rates for VC-funded startups above, if you assume that each failure simply means the entrepreneur tries a new idea.  You have a 18% chance of succeeding on the first try, a 33% chance of succeeding by the second try (82% * 82% = 67.24% chance of failing), a 45% chance of succeeding by the third try, and a 55% chance of succeeding by the fourth try, for an average of 3-4 attempts necessary before success.",

I'm assuming all of us here aren't interested in opening up a mini-mart (rather we're interested in startups in the PG definition of the word -- basically something that scales).  And yet, the \"over half\" figure that's quoted in the article I'm sure includes things like mini-marts.  And I would guess that a mini-mart business has a better chance of staying open over a year than a tech startup does.  So the \"over half\" might be inflated in the other direction. <p>Also, I wonder if companies that in reality fail before one year might just tend to wait until the next tax year comes before officially shutting it down with the government.  If so, depending on how the stats were found, this could inflate the success percentage.",

So which ones get your attention?<p>Solve some problem that you're interested in, place it in public view, foster communication with the users/customers, and listen. Building something specific (\"hey, here's a web-based classifieds system...\"), getting people to use it, and giving them a place to critique it seems to be a good way to get people to tell you what they need built.<p>Building a prototype and then getting people to use it is like writing that initial phrase on a white board, circling it, and asking every one on the web to generate ideas.

                "text": "Another way of looking at this is to realize that beta testers are hard to come by, and one could leverage from the already existing pool of beta testers (53,651). Most startups want to improve their pre-money valuation before going to the VC, the most important ingredient for achieving that is a stable system that is a result of successive relevant iterations of the features. This could as well be part of any Web 2.0 company's road map for the first few months upon going live. It is needless to say that for a VC to be convinced, it is important to have the right kind of users. If there is even a little bit of overlap between the 53,651 web savvy users and the ideal end-user, it is safe to assume that viral marketing will take care of itself. An example that glares in the face is Google. Their systems are the way they are, thanks to their #1 beta testers, their employees. And one could argue that there are other beta testers at various levels, namely the actual end users. This statistic seems to do more good than harm, if regarded positively. The eventual end users of the system could just be an extension of the 53,651 initial users. Go Techcrunch!!!",

Once there, you can apply to receive your social security number, etc.<p>Note that the TN-1 Visa doesn't work if you are planning on being self-employed or entrepreneur in the USA. The people at the border want to see that your employer will pay you and that you need to go there because you are highly qualified for the position. The visa is also voided if you leave your job to take another job or being self-employed.",

It was small but growing when I first joined the staff, having about 2000 registered members and roughly 30-50 simultaneous users at any given time.  Over the next 5 years, it grew to 100,000 registered users and 350-500 simultaneous sessions.<p>This postmortem's describing the project to replace the original upload system - which was basically built on hand-uploaded HTML files and off-the-shelf forum and directory software - with a more modern database system.  This project wasn't really a failure per se: it's in production now, people use it, and FictionAlley's still getting 350 or so simultaneous users.  However, it took <i>much</i> longer and was much more difficult than expected, and the final result has fewer features and more bugs than I'd like.  I initially figured on 3 months to finish; it took 3 years.",

Also he gives netflix as another example, I am thinking DVDs have high markups and there rental structure makes them again a bad example.<p>My real issue with this and his previous article is that its way to over simplified and doesnt give that much useful info except to say don't pick a market thats too small.

I know its better to worry about monetizing a site later, and getting users by giving them something that they want first, but not all startups can use this model.  <p>Also, many sites, especially ones that spread virally (social networking, some dating, and basically anything that revolves around interaction with others instead of just \"tools\") there is an uphill battle to get the first decent size batch of users.  I think linkedin is a good example of this.  It took a while for them to get enough users to make it worthwhile for most professionals (those outside the valley) to want to join it.  \n",

Even if Apollo catches on like nothing since C, it wouldn't kill Firefox; the user still needs a browser.<p>Yes, FF supports rich application development in XUL, and yes, Apollo might compete with that somewhat, but it doesn't really matter.  XUL is there not as a feature but as a tool: the FF UI is built with XUL.  That it is useful for others is really just a detail.  In FF3, there will be more emphasis and support given to XUL apps, but still, it's there for the browser.<p>Also, the degree of competitions between FF and Apollo is, I think, overestimated.  Apollo is basically just another RAD toolkit.  XUL apps aren't desktop apps, they run directly in the browser just like Ajax apps.  That gives them an entirely different use case than Apollo.  (E.g. if FF becomes widespread, XUL might compete with Ajax when building something like gmail.  Apollo wouldn't--a desktop app built with web tech is still a desktop app.)",

If these two companies are fighting for share of a tiny pie, it's just stupid.  If the pie is much bigger than I believe it is, then the game for market share hasn't even begun yet.  The big players haven't even really placed their bets, and that's when things will get interesting (but you have to be there before the big players if you want a chance at walking away a big winner).<p>Anyway, it's not a market I'd want to go after, because I don't see it being big enough for so many contenders (there are others out there--it's not just these two).  But then, almost no market looks big \"enough\" to outsiders.  People are always confused when I make claims about how large our market is (niche software for a 10-20 billion dollar worldwide industry that's increasing at a couple billion per year).<p>So, if they've researched their market and found it large enough to make for big winners in a year or two, now is a fine time to enter it.  Just because you and I know all about 37signals and think they're cool, doesn't mean anybody else knows what the heck they're building.  The real market (folks who aren't web 2.0 developers) hasn't even begun buying this product on the web yet, and they certainly will.  Everybody has an equal chance to be \"first mover\" at this point.",

It will be a challenge determining the initial conversion ratio. But by common logic - it might take 10,000 clicks for someone to buy a Merc online and Merc won't mind paying Goog $500 for it.

You can use curl in php and send all in the background so that the user doesn't have to see some generic \"check out\" page that looks nothing like your site.  <p>The big thing to watch out for is hidden charges, cost of chargebacks (You'll get a few of them no matter how great your service is, mostly out of \"friendly fraud\"), gateway fees, etc..  These costs can rack up really fast and can turn you upside down.  I'd say almost 90% of merchants out there are paying too much for their processing services.<p>Finally, go for a dedicated merchant account, not some 3rd party trash thats basically a reseller.  With a dedicated account, you get paid almost right away into your bank, instead of weekly.  Also, a 3rd party biller is many times more likely to wait until your balance gets high, then terminate your account for some make believe breach of service, possibly destroying your company in minutes.  Theres very little you can do to stop this, lawsuits take forever, and even big name billers will do it to you.  Be careful.",

Without starting off with no experience there are no inputs into the system. The other key problem is understanding that failure and experimentation are net positive inputs into the ecosystem here. It gets harder with this sort of attitude :( For an environment to reach a stable equilibrium between large successes and failures - we need more people to fail and use that to become successful.

That's the problem for industries that have historically generated revenue by artificially restricting access to content: when content distribution (and even production) are without cost or restriction, revenue must come from other sources. This is glaringly obvious for music, and we're headed that way for film. <p>The film industry will do it's best to stay ahead of the bandwidth: 3D projection, better surround sound, etc, but will also need to adapt to make formerly secondary revenue streams (product placement, franchise merchandise, etc) more primary. That and they're going to have to find ways to get their costs down, significantly, to compete with a fast approaching internet and independent film community. \n",

Although there is a small cost to produce it these days every musician dreams of making money off of it. No musician enjoys giving their music up for free. They assume that it'll pay off in the long run(whether that be buying tracks on itunes, getting a cd or a tshirt at their show). Just because the current model for selling music isn't working and piracy is a popular alternative doesn't make music worth nothing.<p>Also, any band already relies on live concerts for their means of money. This is nothing new. What is happening is that major labels are getting a bigger piece of the pie when it comes to merchandise(which used to go straight to the band). I just think a new means of selling music must be created that benefits all parties.<p>",

It would seem that everyone in the valley is very focused on their idea and bringing it to fruition and doesn't have any intention of letting you in on their venture just because you happen to also now live in the Bay Area.<p>Maybe I'm wrong, though; maybe there is a place where post-college hackers in the bay (PCHITB) freely mingle such that newcomers sans partners/friends can enter into their startup, which is otherwise a closed (intentionally so) society; maybe this is a part of the essence of things like Y-Combinator dinners, super happy dev house, etc.  Just thinking outloud at this point. :-)",

However, I do agree with what I believe is the underlying premise--that living in an area of concentrated geekdom will expose you to other geeks in a good way.  But that can occur in college, or at a great company, and many of those exist outside of the Bay Area, albeit with much less frequency . . . but to say that you couldn't find a great hacker in Chicago or New York or Houston if you hung out at the right schools and businesses is a little strong.  Then again, if it's a numbers game, then by all means go to San Fran.  But in some sense it reminds me of how many people hang out in Palm Beach hoping to fall in love with someone that just happens to be a millionaire.  My suspicion is that geek cliques do form, and they often form in college.  That to me is the bigger point than saying 'if you want to start a startup, you should put a flower in your hair and . . .'.  \n",

They are designers trying to create something unique, trying to find a spark.  When successful, it's usually a small crowd that \"gets it\": they're passionate about it while many, maybe even a majority, hate it.  If it's truly good, eventually the majority gets converted.  I'm in the majority with the Honda Element, for example: to my shock I'm beginning to come around.<p>Most edge design, though, IS ugly, will gain only hedging admiration from the designer's mother and averted gazes from his wife.

There also seem to be a bunch of mobile companies here, too.<p>There's a very healthy ecology of small software companies, and a lot of web companies. There's a bit of defence and aerospace around the airport, but I think Montreal and Ottawa  are bigger than Toronto, for that.<p>Kitchener's not <i>too</i> far away, and they're a major powerhouse with U of Waterloo, and RIM.<p>ATI just got acquired by AMD, and Alias by Autodesk, so there should be some newly minted angel investors around.\nI haven't sought financing, so I don't know what that's like. Having been through some private-equity as an employee, the funding definitely seems to be out there.<p>I think we're building a pretty good tradition, but it's going to take time. The seeds are there though, looking back over the last 20 years (god, I'm getting old!). There's nothing like the unholy Stanford-VC-startup triad yet.<p>So, I'm not really sure what to say. It's probably harder to get funded here than in CA, and you obviously won't get the same buzz as being YC-funded. On the other hand, if you want to work at a startup or small, hip shop then there're lots of places here.<p>EDIT If I ever move out of my home-office, I'm going to try to set up next to the U of T comp sci and engineering buildings. That's the nice thing about a down-town campus.",

Keep in mind, Dozens of mods and hacks have been written for Tivos, many which greatly enhance the built in functionality [2]..<p>The question now is what will Apple Do- They could go either the Tivo/Xbox route and try to lock it down, or go the Linksys route, and embrace the hackers and agree that they add value.<p>\nIt's too early to tell for sure which route they'll take, but from early indications it looks like they're A) Making it easy to hack- This lets people develop on it, and make cool things, without getting in the way.. They are doing this while also b) Not guaranteeing that the system won't change..<p>Essentially, anything made for it can stop working with the next set fromt eh factory. This means that most companies would be insane to develop anything for it, since their investment could be stopped by a third party in a second..<p>It seems like what Apple is doing is letting Hackers play and extend, while stopping any larger players from getting involved.<p>Interesting move.<p>\n[1]<a href=\"http://crunchgear.com/2007/03/23/hackers-hack-hacked-apple-tv-to-play-divx/\">http://crunchgear.com/2007/03/23/hackers-hack-hacked-apple-tv-to-play-divx/</a>\n[2] Such as the ability to have a web interface, to schedule recordings from work\n",

Twitter, however, is designed for telecocooning. Telecocooning is traditionally defined as sending little \"presence pokes\" to people. For example, just saying hi or sending someone a picture of a heart or a smiley face. The point of these messages isn't the ideas they contain, but rather the message itself. That is, just getting any message from someone shows that the other person is thinking about them and cares about them.<p>Traditionally people telecocoon with their two or three closest friends. However, Twitter lowers the telecocooning barrier so you can telecocoon with many more friends for the same effort. People tend to just send messages like \"ahh homework sucks\" or \"heh stuck at the library.\" You aren't really communicating anything intelligent, but you are building a feeling of group solidarity by letting people around you know what's up. It also helps people to find where their friends are if they want to meet up.\n",

If that was acceptable to users, we'd have the opportunity to expand on the areas that  were getting the most use, while (all the while battling the marketing dept -- \"It's already there, what's the harm???\") dropping the features that were rarely used, or (even more telling!) got initiated but not completed.<p>That could lead to some radical simplifying of applications, all to the advantage of the user.

Whereas a serial founder would find it difficult to just drop everything he has been doing until today and move to something else because folks higher up said so. <p>Going back to NetFlix and Blockbuster, I think it just shows that the future isn't so much in coming out with scientifically earth shattering ideas but rather bettering something that already exists.",

Go find somewhere that has Yellow Pages listings (and if all else fails your local telco is required by law to sell it to you), and guess what, in its basic form they're not copyrightable.  Address plus name plus phone number, even when combined with a business category, is not original enough to be afforded copyright protection.  So copy them.  I know that's hard to believe because the US has such a low bar for copyrightability, but there have been very specific court cases that I commend to you in order to check it out for yourself.",

Second, we employ\nstatistical gender models to build GENDERLENS -- a novel intelligent news filtering system that customizes news based on the gender of its reader.

This makes your customers think that you are actively developing your product and that there is momentum behind your product.\"<p>This statement really irks me, not just as a programmer, but as a consumer.  I initially thought the article might be a little joke, but since the other tips were more reasonable, I have to assume that it is serious.  I can understand holding back features in your initial release, but there are much better reasons than those that were cited.  To purposely trick your potential users seems to me to be a bad business model, and smells of the corporate mindset of money and growth over all else. I think it is important to remember that the whole point of developing a product is to fulfill a need (or want) of the customer, and I think that as the average consumer gets more intelligent, these types of tactics will be more transparent and will do more harm than good to the startup.<p>As for better reasons for holding back features:<p>1. In any interesting piece of software, I would imagine that there are potentially hundreds of features which could be added.  The difficult problem is deciding when to be (temporarily) content with what you have and release.  Thus, some desired features must be left out in order to avoid the perfectionist mindset, where nothing ever gets released.<p>2. A mostly-implemented feature may work correctly most of the time, but fail mysteriously at other times. Even with a beta release, it's probably best to avoid these types of features which only serve to make your product less reliable.<p>3. A feature may be fully-implemented, but there may be no clear way to integrate it into the UI.  In this case, it would probably be best to hold off and drop hints of the feature to beta testers, who could give their feedback on how best to integrate it.  After all, the feature is meant for the users to actually use, isn't it?<p>4. A feature may add computational complexity to the software which may be overly taxing on the initial hardware that a startup company is using. Improve the hardware before adding the feature, or better yet, improve the code which implements the feature.<p>\nAm I being overly idealistic?  Am I alone in thinking that the proposed \"marketing trick\" is a bad idea?",

The whole point of the \"beta\" label is to alert potential users that the product is not completely stable, but is in some usable state.  The problem is not so much that the service was not 100% reliable, but that the NYT readers expected it to be and relied critically upon it.<p>As most Linux and 'BSD users have come to learn, \"beta\" means just that: not ready for critical use.  The user gains some privileges, like being able to use \"bleeding-edge\" software or to get a valuable service for free, and in return they sacrifice the stability and reliability that comes with time-tested software; all that as they actually are an integral piece to testing that software. Without such a beta stage, the whole rapid development movement would fail as projects get mired in extensive internal testing stages.<p>Your GMail comment especially strikes me, as I hadn't considered that before.  Perhaps they grew much faster than anticipated and are still working on stability issues, and the \"losing my emails\" scenario may not be far off the mark.  By attaching the \"beta\" label to their service, they can probably avoid any liability that may arise if such an event did occur.",

Is Arrington pulling punches because he's already been positive?<p>Arrington claims people expecting Grand Central to do what is says are putting too much faith in a beta product. What you can get away with has a lot to do with your offering. I'm not going to stop watching justin.tv because it's down (like right now, completely dead). But I'm not sure if beta is a good enough excuse for me to miss calls from clients. Especially now that beta is ubiquitous and virtually meaningless. Gmail certainly would not be off the hook for losing my emails. Is it really just caveat emptor for beta products as he suggests?",

                "text": "These are the precise questions that my startup, Knowitall.tv, is trying to answer. What will advertising look like as video programming and advertising dollars shift to the web? Where are those advertising dollars going to go, who will decide on the content these dollars will fund, and who will provide this content?<p>I think the most important thing Garfield notes in this article is the huge shift in power has occurred with the advent of dvr and web video. People don't have to sit through flashy, in-your-face ads that shout 'buy me!.' These ads can be fast-forwarded or deleted. On the web, the attention span of the viewer is drastically reduced by the sheer volume and choice of content. Why would I watch an ad when I don't have to on this site over here? The audience is no longer captive. The student has become the teacher. We are in charge. <p>Advertising and networks are not doomed in any sense.  However, traditional, 'flashy' ads will have to be replaced by more informative, interactive, gentle, pull advertising content. Think product placement, contests, video games, informational videos... Ad content will also be interactive-the best way to extend the short-attention span of the average web user. Just because networks are reeling in costs does in no way mean that they are 'over.'  \n  \nYes, traditional purveyors of advertising and large networks should be concerned, but only if they do not adapt to this huge shift in power. These networks and ad companies became successful because of innovation and I am sure they will temper the storm. However, who should be taking close note of this market shift is ambitious independent producers and content providers. There is a huge gap in the market for a few companies to sneak in and make an absolute killing. <p>To summarize: Because the viewer is in charge, ads in the future will inform rather than entertain, engage rather than impress, so really, the only question to answer is, what do the end users want to know and from whom?\nI believe local expertise and endorsement to be the untapped goldmine of this 'new' advertising.",

Besides, why compete with a free product?</i>  Once I actually visited the site and read the philosophy, however, I have to concede that it's at least worth a shot.  This idea is clearly the result of someone saying, \"What is wrong with Wikipedia, and how can we fix it?\"  The main problems, as I see it, are:<p>1. Defacing of high-profile articles.\n- This is potentially solved by requiring the use of real names, and also by the oversight.<p>2. Perceived inaccuracy.\n- While Wikipedia does at times have inaccuracies, the reality is that the media and others who do not often use it have an exaggerated view of the extent of the inaccuracy. By adding expert oversight, this should quell some of the cries regarding lack of reliability.<p>The only potential problems I see is that Wikipedia already has a lot of inertia, which includes a much better name.  Citizendium is just too hard to say to become a buzzword.  It will also see much slower growth, and I posit that it will never be able to reach the size of Wikipedia, because its growth function is inherently less steep.<p>That said, one could contend that the majority of quality articles on Wikipedia are submitted by a very small minority of the users.  If even some of these authors move to Citizendium due to frustration with the constant maintenance of their articles or the incorrect perception of inaccuracy, then Citizendium truly has a chance.  But someone still needs to change the name.",

The point is, everybody who has a small business or sold a startup, no matter what age they are right now, they started their quest for independence when they were 18, or 25.  And, the only way to get experience at anything is to do it.\"<p>The great thing about software is how few Americans are doing it.  There are many bright programmers in Asia but unfortunately their economies, political barriers, and upbringing preclude them from starting their own businesses.  This is even true in places like England and France.<p>And, of those who are in America or are born in the US, very few even want to start a company, with the amount of money some companies pay (and the catered lunches, and all that jazz.)<p>So, there are very few of us who understand that it is our duty in life to start our own businesses, figure out the logistics, and then hire all these smart people around the world who deserve to work for great and smart people like us.  It is not a choice to create a new startup.  It is our duty, because 99% of American programmers are either too content with their life or only dedicate 2 hours a day to creating something (plus have no understanding of what exactly they are trying to accomplish so they give up early), and the other programmers in other countries have no hope of ever starting a business, no matter how good their grades are, or how smart and ambitious they are.<p>It is our duty to create startups that solve some problem and help people, and give people jobs.<p>Also, remember that you may think you're getting 100% of the experience working for a startup or running a part-time business, but unless you make it your only source of income, you are not really giving it 100%.  This also means you are not receiving 100% of the experience someone else (like a competitor) is getting out of their full-time effort.",

I don't think that this is a necessary property of web applications.  The problem is that most web applications now are ad-based, and they want their consumers' only access point to be through their website, where they can get revenue.  If that model is changed, it would not be overly complicated to create an API to your application which would allow integration with other applications in some way.  If I can use sshfs to make a remote filesystem look exactly like a local one, surely it's possible to write hooks into your web app to integrate it with other desktop software.",

He told me, just before opening, that the first 3 days would make or break the shop.

                        "text": "The problem with motivation for an undergrad is when you realize that everything doesn't need to be the way it is now.  Let me clarify.  Most of us have been raised our whole lives with the mantra, \"You have to go to college to succeed.\"  I know that my parents didn't go to college, and they were always saying, \"You don't want to end up where I am, working in a factory,\" etc.<p>The problem with that model, however, is that a standard undergraduate education is beginning to become old-fashioned and irrelevant.  How many stories do you hear about students going to four years of school only to graduate and be unable to find employment?  While the problem is not nearly as bad in engineering as in other fields, it's still the case that more and more people are going to college, and as a result, a degree doesn't look nearly as great as it did 20 or 30 years ago.<p>I personally have started to become disenfranchised with the college model in the US.  As an undergrad, I have visited some undergraduate committee meetings and talked personally with a few professors, and the bureaucracy of the whole thing is somewhat disgusting.  Even if a professor wants to make a change to the curriculum (for the better), he or she must endure countless meetings and votes, even for something that is clearly a good idea.  It may take a year or more just to make a minor structural change in a few core courses.<p>Moreover, department heads are not much worried about the success (or lack thereof) of undergrads.  For whatever reason, national groups that rank colleges look mainly at entrance criteria, so as long as the college can successfully lock out those students with low ACT scores (which are largely irrelevant), they look good on paper.  Meanwhile, they hire new professors based <i>only</i> on their research and some interviews, without much regard for teaching backgrounds.<p>In the end, once you go off and create your own startup and work on your own projects, you start to see that college is largely not helpful to an undergrad.  The stuff that is stretched out over four years could probably be learned quite easily by most in two or less, if it was all restructured a bit.  College, in effect, is just another corporation, one that is in the business of paying professors and researching new ideas.  It just happens that most professors do not produce enough ideas quickly enough to justify their income, so undergraduate students make up for that by paying tuition.<p>Once you realize that you can be successful without completing (or even starting) your undergrad, the dedication, motivation, and finances necessary to complete college just don't look like such a good trade anymore.  Most courses follow a textbook, anyways, so just buy the textbook, study it yourself, talk to people online, and you will probably do just as well.  The only downside is that you'll be missing that shiny piece of paper.",

My husband and I are bringing our children along for the journey as we work on our start-up. <p>We went through the start-up stage with another business before we had children, but we won't think of postponing this start-up because of our kids. It is hard work to combine starting up and parenting, but being parents while working a traditional 9-to-5 is hard work, too. <p>We have found that we are happier when we are being creative on our own, regardless of income level. When we're happy, the kids are happy, too.<p>They have adapted well to everything we've thrown at them so far. And we are encouraged by their go-with-the-flow attitude.<p>In the end we want them to understand that you make your own life. The best way we can teach them this is to actually do so ourselves....and that's what we are doing.<p>Sounds like that's what you are doing, too.\n \n",

As a little kid, I had no awareness that we were rich or poor, though we must have struggled because I remember different living situations were not as nice as others. Our family life was happiest during the building phase of the company - before success was surely won. <p>One thing I'm sure of is that my dad would have been miserable if he had a straight job and that would have affected our family a lot more than material instability. <p>There are many lessons that you can teach a child about resilience - about fortune's ups and downs and how to handle risk that are unavailable to those who put their lives on hold to rear a child. I wouldn't have had any other childhood. We had extreme fortune upheavals. At one point, the family lost everything. But dad started again and made a success. I still wound up attending an Ivy League school and hope to apply the lessons I've learned growing up to the startups I'll start.\n",

                "text": "Hi, Omarish.  The tragedy of the commons (economists call these situations \"negative externalities\") doesn't apply to Web 2.0 in my opinion.  <p>The tragedy of the commons stems from a basic cost/benefit calculation: in business, if something costs you more than you make, you either stop selling it or you go out of business.  The basic problem of a negative externality is that while the profit accrues to an individual, the cost hidden from that individual and is borne by the community.  So a non-viable activity continues to be performed, until the community goes bankrupt. (I.e., the field is depleted and cannot sustain sheep).  Some argue that pollution falls into this category.  (Note that this is not necessarily an argument for private ownership of everything: the principle problem is costs exceeding benefits, and those costs being hidden from producers so that their incentives are misaligned.  Privatization is one way, but probably not the only way, to align incentives.)<p>But in Web 2.0, there are no hidden costs that are depleting the overall store.  Companies pay for their bandwidth, pay for their storage, etc.  No costs are shifted to the community as near as I can tell.  <p>A better model for what you're talking about might be network effects -  <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Network_effects\">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Network_effects</a>\n",

The core challenge is to print a lot of data on an A4 / US Letter sized piece of paper, and then get that data back off the paper and into an application running on a cell phone.<p>Ideally, this would work on any old phone. Realistically, this would be vertically integrated - you'd get to pick the phone, and the printing format for the page containing the data. From the specs and the initial discussions I've had with companies in the field, the speed of light for 2D bar codes is about 3mb per page (Data Matrix) and the choke point is mobile phone camera quality, particularly focal length issues (can't focus properly on the close page.)<p>Approaches: using better phones, deconvolution algorithms, c'mon guys, you know how to fix this.<p>After that, there's some extremely simple large scale database stuff which looks, to my eye at least, to be a natural fit for REST. <p>Basically:<p>Yank data off the page<p>think about it<p>do stuff over GPRS/3G or - ugh - SMS (yeah... SMS out, SMS back... terse data formats.)<p>Done.<p>Nothing about this is difficult. The crypto fits in just to ensure data integrity - make sure that the bar codes haven't been damaged, or that the data on the bar codes isn't stale.<p>Ok? Enough here to be going on with? Do we need to belabor the point further? For the right team, <i></i>assuming<i></i> the deal comes through, this would be an easy gig.<p>If it doesn't, there's no gig, no client, no business, even if I disclosed the rest of the pieces here. So it's a potential and there's not much you can do to make it happen or not. But if it does come through, first plausible team might make a pretty good living for a few months and possibly be left with a viable company at the end of it. Can't promise more than that. In terms of IP, there would be full disclosure, no NDAs, no patents on my work as I described. There could be competition, although probably not, and for other reasons I'm not simply posting the whole damn design on the internet (more on that angle later.)<p>Ok, done. Nothing more I can think of to tell you, please ask more questions either here or by email.<p>Vinay",

                "text": "Hi. My name is Vinay Gupta. I'm an environmentalist and refugee infrastructure consultant by trade, although I did spend about 10 years doing software including a number of start ups. My projects include minor roles in <a href=\"http://oilendgame.org/\">http://oilendgame.org/</a> <a href=\"http://smallisprofitable.org\">http://smallisprofitable.org</a> and technical lead on <a href=\"http://database.biomimicry.org/\">http://database.biomimicry.org/</a><p>My main project is an award winning, public domain / free/libre refugee shelter system called the hexayurt.<p>So, I've got a technology that I'm looking to get turned into a product. For ethical reasons there will be no patents or IP protection - you could write a closed implementation, patent additional side features etc - but the basic ideas are already disclosed. The cat is out of the bag, because this is refugee stuff which <i>just happens</i> to have some other applications, and so I disclosed it to make sure it would not be patentable from my work. There may be other patent issues, although none have arisen so far - we have yet to hit prior art.<p>Technologies: mobile phone programming, 2D bar codes, very large databases, and some basic understanding of cryptosystems. Like, how to call the libraries, not how to roll your own broken encryption.<p>Now, here's the kicker: if I'm not <i>entirely</i> mistaken, I have a customer lined up. A Large Customer. If that turns out not to be true, there's no point starting this thing.<p>If, however, it is, the gig would start with one large contract, and then if you can then make this into a company, you go right ahead. I'm fully engaged pushing the Hexayurt Shelter System (a free/libre refugee infrastructure system) and don't have time to do a start up. I can advise, and make the introductions. From there in it would be up to you to make it a success, working with that client. My compensation is likely to be largely as a subcontractor to that client, working on the design end.<p>Interested? hexayurt@gmail.com",

In many cases, though, it can be overkill: a waste of bandwidth and programmer time (i.e. it would be unnecessary for the Google home page to use AJAX to display search results).  As an occasional Lynx user, I really appreciate when a site keeps alternate browsers in mind.<p>That said, I agree with jw that catering to users of ancient, insecure browsers is probably a waste of time and a barrier to progress.  I disagree with a strict cost-benefit approach, however.  As an analogy, Microsoft has been benefiting from this phenomenon for years due to hardware companies who only write Windows drivers, while NVidia is a good example of a hardware company which provides open source drivers and receives loyalty and sales opportunities because of it.  Additionally, supporting cell phone users and the visually impaired is certainly a good idea, even if only a small percentage of visitors fall into these categories.<p>Of course, as numerous others mentioned, it's important to be aware of your target audience, but don't be surprised if your actual audience does not necessarily match the one you have in mind.",

One of the things I asked her was if the 'small-fry' oil and gas industry was being smothered by the giants of Exxon, BP, and Shell much as some people claim is being done by Microsoft, Google, and Yahoo. She replied that the big three are only able to pursue and develop the projects which show a high margin due to their high operating costs thereby allowing small ventures to flourish in projects that aren't 'profitable enough'.<p>Certainly this argument has also been made for the internet market too, but the oil and gas market is heavily capital dependent with large 'retooling' costs whereas the internet industry is driven largely by a smart labor force (ie: a more agile industry). So is it a possibility that small time internet ventures are more vulnerable to attack than the equivalent oil and gas company (and other industries for that matter)?",

It wasn't just generic company stuff- I remember some of the programmers talking about shots they made in the paintball, and how they could implement those in the engine.<p>Later still, I worked at a startup. Working at a startup we were all closer to one another- We often put in long hours to try to get the next revision out, or the next round of bugs squashed. While we haven't done any massive outings yet, we've developed out little in-house traditions. We \"always\" go out to Foo for food, or \"always\" do Halo games after a hard night of code..

But then I started working at a 10,000 person company and began to realize we weren't all that after all, the real Peter Framptons were the ones innovating at big companies. You build something brilliant while simultaneously serving literally billions of customers? Party on, you TRULY rock. ...'</i> [2]<p>So this is what Fake is up to.

(Easier said than done.)<p>Plus, if you become really big--and saving 50 cents in processing fees per order will start to add up--the other shopping cart / payment processors will be knocking at your door, writing their own API for you, and giving you better deals.  Or, if the problem is that they don't have enough features for you right now, just e-mail them your suggestions.  By the time you go live, they will probably have a lot of the features you requested.  Again, I don't know anything about any shopping cart.<p>If you spend time on the more difficult and complicated method when there is no urgency for it right now, when you know there's a faster and easier method available that lets you go back to working on the main product, you will just HATE your entire project.<p>Instead, take the easier/faster option, as you will be able to go back to working on the actual product or service sooner, so there will be less boredom.  When the situation actually arises that it DOES matter which shopping cart you have, the urgency of the need will motivate you to make the switch, and you will be excited about succeeding.  On the other hand, if you take the harder method right now, you will not be excited--at the end of it all, you will be angry it has taken so much time when there was an easier method.  Plus, 3-6 months from now, you'll probably have to modify the ordering system no matter which shopping cart you started with.  Or, what if you decide to stay in beta for the next year (not accepting any payments)?<p>As you can see, I've made that mistake before...  This is a motivational speech for me as much as it is for you. ;)",

                "text": "Here are some thoughts I have regarding popularity meters on news sites and such. Maybe some people would find it interesting or possibly useful. I would also love to hear other opinions, so do share.<p>I am sure many readers here have seen the new SlashRating box, which sports digg-esque (generally speaking) number ratings for each article. Maybe you noticed that the Gmail Paper article (<a href=\"http://slashdot.org/articles/07/04/01/0631243.shtml)\">http://slashdot.org/articles/07/04/01/0631243.shtml)</a> and the X-Files article right after it (<a href=\"http://slashdot.org/articles/07/04/01/1231211.shtml)\">http://slashdot.org/articles/07/04/01/1231211.shtml)</a> have substantially different SlashRatings (1000x+ difference). Humor aside, they may both be valid ratings. Readers familiar with digg (easy example) have seen ratings ranging from the single digits, to way through the thousands. I believe there is a limit to the informativeness of the number rating. And while many services have jumped onto using similar number-based displays of popularity, here I make a case for the relative measure.<p>As a passer-by, casual reader on digg (which is most readers), when you see a page full of ratings in the hundereds, you probably process only two things from the score: the digit length and leftmost digit. When a 1000+ rating appears, you immediately know from the digit length that it is a magnitude more popular. More than what? More than the surrounding articles. Naturally, your eyes will notice the highest ratings within the page. If you reach a page full of articles rated in the thousands, readers probably apply the same strategy: scan the digit length and the leftmost digit. Unless two or more articles are rated on a higher order of magnitude than the rest, readers would likely ignore the less significant digits -- and when such a comparison is required, the articles are probably popular enough that you read them all.<p>After you mentally shift to a scale of comparison, you ignore details on other orders of magnitude; this is, for example, how your eyes adjust to consistently bright, or dark, environments. Of course numbers are easy to output and fast to read, and details may be interesting and important to the developers, but for browsing efficiency, most readers do not care, nor need to know, if something is rated 4903, or 4692, points, as long as a reference exists for comparison. And this reference will always depend on the number of participating users at a given moment. A better system should thus display only a relative measurement of popularity within a given timeframe. This idea is not necessarily new, but I believe it is definitely a better approach to popularity measurements, and moreso if you are expecting your project to eventually support a large votership.<p>An existing example to illustrate good use of this is something like a community download site. Say something is \"popular\" when over 50% of the users download it. It makes more sense then, to just write \"popular\" when total_downloads / total_users  0.5, rather than showing \"1,040 downloads!\", or even \"5,503,395 downloads!\" (okay, millions is different... but if your users were, like, ants, big deal). In the end, \"popularity\" is a relative measure.<p>I'm sure many folks here have thoughts on related issues; let's hear them :)",

For their product to catch on, they'll have to design an all around better interface than the current desktop metaphor. For Parakey to succeed in the long run, they need to appeal to power/traditional computer users as well.<p>I applied to Y Combinator with a very similar idea to Parakey, only entirely web-based. I got an interview last funding round, but PG and company weren't convinced we had solved the design problem.<p>You can see a quick design demo at www.granmos.com/420 (best viewed in full screen in Firefox). If nothing else, I think it shows how easy it can be to provide a compelling, intuitive experience to an older computer novice.  I'm very excited to see what Parakey actually looks like, I see the design as much more important to their success than their cross-platorm development technology.<p>\nBlake, one thing that is necessary for you to succeed with people older than 70 is to provide alternatives to the mouse. People over a certain age just don't get it; it's too hard cognitively to translate movement on the horizontal plane to motion on a vertical screen. Touch screens are ideal but expensive. Track balls are better, because they more concretely separate the action of clicking and moving.",

To some people, that title conveys anger rather than the humor that was intended.  Anger is generally not professional, in that it interferes with productivity.<p>But saying it was \"unprofessional\" carries a whole lot of semantic baggage that probably isn't appropriate.  It calls to mind an impractical ideal of workplace behavior that encourages complete suppression of all natural human emotion.  Certain aspects of professionalism are good, but unfortunately \"unprofessional\" often turns into a blanket (often hypocritical) label for \"anything I don't like.\"<p>I recommend any time you find yourself wanting to use the word \"unprofessional,\" see if there isn't something less abstract that would work instead.

Saying that it's a bust, bubble burst, or crash is just a plea for attention. The go-IPO-with-no-business craze does not exist this time around.

How difficult would it be to create a system by which you could \"annotate\" video?: you could add tags to objects in the video that could allow viewers to link to the product page: <p>- for instance, when an actor lifts a can of coke, you could click on it, go to the coke page. \n- an actor's face could go to the wiki or imdb entry. \n- might be an interesting way to take brand awareness advertising (product placement) and make some conversions to actual purchases. <p>Add some options to hide/show these annotations, and maybe you could (unobtrusively) actually make some money off of video. Anyway, enough rambling about an unrefined idea.. just looking for feedback or thoughts or links to existing stuff like this.<p>",

I'm just glad to see someone might be doing something cool to circumvent the current college standard. <p>As much as i talk about college being a big fat waste of time and money, I generally enjoyed my time spent there. I had an awesome marketing job with one of the greatest companies/brands in the world and made some stellar contacts. It was the job offers halfway through college that showed me that the experience was worth MUCH more than the diploma. Finding out that jobs that \"require\" college degrees really just require proof that you are capable and determined was a great realization. <p>If you can demonstrate to a company that you have what it takes, waiting for you to finish your degree could be a waste of time for all parties involved. <p>So if your goal is to get a good job... it is entirely possible without a degree. Your friends and family may tell you otherwise, and very few people will encourage you to drop out to take a job... but it's your decision. Having a degree hardly dictates your happiness or success as a person. <p>I ended up leaving school after 3.5 years. Not to take a job, just because it was clearly a waste of my time. I wanted to focus on starting/building my company, and school was just getting in the way of that. Incidentally I found (sorta like Seth) a way that I could get my last semester's worth of credits from my university - so i'll still have that \"all mighty piece of paper\" in a couple months.<p>My suggestion to people usually is: Do what you want! Fitting the social norm is easy and will probably work out for you, but it might not be the best choice. If I were to go to college again, I'd study something that interested me as a person. Not something that I felt was a happy medium between interesting and a safe career path. <p><i></i><i></i><i>\nYou should go to college to learn about something you think is cool & enjoy your time spent there. Study art or music, history of physics... something that will make you want to attend early morning class discussions. Get involved on campus, network with people, and use your free-time to read and figure out how you're going to make your mark. If you're just going to school to prepare for a job... rethink why you'd spend your time and money being lectured and quizzed on material from drab books who's curriculum is behind the times anyway. If you are planning to start a company, you'll know for yourself if college is important to you or not. <p>",

Actually the current systems are rather unsatisfying because a state can loose its credibility and thus the trust in its curreny quite fast, basically as soon as war looms on the horizon or it becomes apparent that it will default on its debt. In the last 25 years over 87 currencies crashed.\nAnd because of the monopoly of the state on money the whole economy is usually going down along. For my part I would therefore abandon the monetary monopoly of the state and allow competition, allow companies to issue money. When they connect their name to the currency and have no legal power to make their money legal tender they will have a much stronger incentive to provide a good and stable money. Hayek wrote a fascinating treatise on the denationalisation of money, and with the ongoing globalisation sooner or later we will get used to juggle with more than one currency in our pockets. Second Life seems to be a step in the direction that companies start to issue private currencies and when states, especially in the developing countries, will fail to keep their currency stable chances are that they will be replaced by private currencies. <p>Equally interesting and probably easier to believe are gold backed currencies with competing private institutes issuing goldbacked money.<p>Still, its great to see people thinking about money in another way than just how to get it.\n",

You can then be assured of their creative and intellectual abilities, as well understanding how you'll work together as a team. <p>For other positions, you're obviously going to want to look for smart people, but a key thing for a small startup is to look for smart people who can do many different things well.  For example, I'd be more inclined to choose a s/w eng who has done well designing a web app, and has designed embedded software for a consumer electronics device than an eng who has worked only on web apps for their entire career.<p>As for the second part of your question, I'd agree with e1ven - neither type of question is key, although they do help establish technical ability & creativity.  <p>But my experience diverges from e1vens' in at least one respect - you don't need to choose between problem solvers and cogs (at least as he has defined them).

The Rick is offering the founder shares in his own company as compensation for not taking a salary!  <p>The inherent assumption behind this asinine perspective is that \"Preferred\" shares are for VCs only... but the reality is that VCs offer nothing to warrant such preferences.   Everyone who has put sweat equity into the company is just as much an investor, and is generally taking on more risk... but the VC expects to be given preferences because such terms are common, and they are common because too many startups cave because they are addicted to the cash.<p>Love that the liquidation preference is \"only\" 1X.  The reality is that it is screwing over all the other investors in the company by saying that the VC goes to the front of the line, gets all their money back, and <i>then</i> gets the percentage of anything left over comensurate with their percentage ownership of the company.   The implication being that employees have not actually invested in the company and if there's anything left over, then the employees and founders get some. <p>This is particularly insulting given that the liklihood of this preference being relevant is increased by taking VC money-- which in this day and age means forgoing almost certain profitability for a higher risk shot at hitting it out of the ballpark. <p>And the price for putting a bomb under your company and lighting the fuse?  They get to be first in line when it explodes and the company is liquidated for much less than it would have gotten if it was a viable business.<p>An employee that puts in $100k worth of labor a year for five years and gets $50k in salary has invested $250k just as much as an investor who puts in $250k in cash.<p>The arrogance of preferences boggles the mind. <p>Nobody in YC should be looking for this kind of investment.  Stick with angels.  Give everyone common- recognize that investors who are only putting in money are fairly compensated by getting shares at a fair valuation.  If they want liduidation preferences, they should pay for it- and thus be investing at a multiple of the valuation that common gets.<p>VC funding was made obsolete in 2000.

Marketing and sales are REALLY tricky for technical people, who seem to believe that the market is somehow fair...that having a \"better\" product will naturally result in the customers abandoning the competition and running to your product.  Only in the idealist's world are buying decisions made based on features and benefits.  In many markets the users of a product or service ARE NOT the same people who make the decision whether to buy the product the product or service.  The users and the purchasers may have completely different interests. I learned this the VERY HARD  WAY starting a business...sometime better and faster doesn't matter when your competition has a prestigeous brand or the purchasing decision maker only cares about price (since the users are a different group...the purchasers don't really care about making the user's life better).<p>I would actually separate the \"marketing\" hat from the \"sales\" hat.   Sales guys want a list of leads to call or visit. They seldom have ideas about how to generate leads. Sales guys can get the door slammed in their face or the phone hung up on them multiple times in a day without needing antidepressants.   Marketing people need to go to the therapist when someone hangs up on them but they can figure out how to get a list of the right people for your sales guy to call and they can figure out what word to spend your google adsense budget on.\n",

Now they are adding some customization tools to go a little beyond that (and touch into more of the long tail).<p>That said, I think the Geoff fellow put it best when he commented on the post:<p>\"Sure, Google is great at the tech, but they are a bit weak when it comes to building 'places'. They don't have enough touchy feely people over there to get the warms and fuzzies right. So, their sites, while they work well, all feel very cold and sterile, and don't really build a social community. That's why Google Video didn't take off and they bought YouTube.\"<p>Our startup is geography-heavy, but our mantra has been 'we are not a mash-up.'  This is because we are aiming for the warm and fuzzies (serving the needs of a specific community of users), and almost all mash-ups that I've seen lack the warm and fuzzies because the Google Maps API limits their ability to custom-tailor their service and presentation.  I don't think these few new buttons greatly change that.  <p>As an aside, one of the reasons I really enjoyed Chris Anderson's speech at Startup School was his repeated assertion that one-size-fits-all solutions are (in some ways) necessarily inferior to products and services that focus on the niche.

                "text": "Rick Segal's approach seems the most charitable. <p>It works similarly in dating. \n(Note that I date with the goal of marriage in mind - definitely not a player, which makes this a good analogy to the good VC's - they're hoping to 'marry' founders when it's a good match)<p>Many guys burn bridges when they have to break up with a girl. However, that's totally unnecessary! I've certainly done that when I was a teen, but have found the charitable approach much more effective. Let me be clear that 'charitable' does not mean unclear or deceptive in the breakup. On the contrary - it's being very clear and honest about the breakup with the girl. That being said, you <i>do</i> withhold any information that would unnecessarily hurt her (ex: you're not attracted to something about her that she can't help).<p>The breakup needs to establish that:<p>1) the relationship is not a match for you, but that that is no reflection on her personally in the slightest<p>2) you genuinely admire the N number of amazing things about her<p>3) you hope that you both can still be good friends, but that you understand and honor her wish if she thinks it's better not to<p>4) the romantic possibilities of your relationship are just not there sufficient for marriage and never will be (let her move on with closure!) Don't worry, if you change your mind later you can crawl back on your knees to her and tell her you were wrong - but you have to let her go and pursue other possibilities.<p>5) you are open to talk with her about it at any time - this will usually relieve a lot of her anxiety about having to wonder why you broke up later.<p>Note: Be careful about the 'still being friends' thing. If you are hanging out too much with her, most other guys will avoid asking her out - and you don't want to hinder her ability to move on. Be sure to honor her space and let her know that you are doing that so she doesn't feel rejected by it.<p>Success stories:<p>2004 girlfriend: Good breakup, she decided it was better for her to not have contact. I honored that and imagine she has gone on to great things.<p>2005 girlfriend: Good breakup, though we did get back together several times. Ultimately it ended, but our communication was so good that we have remained best friends since then and talk regularly about our new relationships. We both are huge advocates of each other - she sells me to other girls and I sell her to other guys. We do business together too since there is such a high level of trust.<p>2006 girlfriend: Had a great time together, but we both knew it wouldn't work. We had great communication and though it was hard for me to let her go, I did and that really impressed her to the point where we have a similar high-trust, high-advocate relationship as with 2005 girlfriend.<p>2007 girlfriend: Ended about a week ago. So far so good. Very hard for both of us. But we've had good communication since and it is evolving well into a good friend relationship.<p>Note that these tips assume that you are only dating reasonably sane girls - with psycho chics this probably won't apply ;)<p>It's important to remember that going the charitable route is often harder in the short-term than the alternatives, but it's important to suck it up and have the kahoonas to do it right. Some guys may be tempted to not give her a clean break or feel they have to diminish her as a person to satisfy their own insecurities. DON'T DO IT! Seriously, it will hammer your karma and make life much more difficult for you in the long-term. To illustrate: 2006 girlfriend only dated me because of the good things 2005 girlfriend told her about how good our relationship and breakup was. The same with 2007 girlfriend. It's really the way to go if you can be respectful and honor them, because more often than not, they will return the sentiment.<p>(sorry for the length - it started as a comment, but turned into a full post - hopefully a few will find some value in it ;)<p>Update: I decided to make this a full-on post at: <a href=\"http://blog.nanobeepers.com/2007/04/05/breaking-up-is-hard-to-do/\">http://blog.nanobeepers.com/2007/04/05/breaking-up-is-hard-to-do/</a>",

                "text": "Though it could be said in a much less offensive way, I agreed with this in the article<p>\"I read YCombinator Startup News. I read that thing that Paul wrote saying that anybody who contributes regularly is going to fare better. That\u0092s shit from a bull! Anybody who is spending time posting on a site that is a collection of links to dream money instead of working on his project is never going to make money. Anybody who cares about \u0093karma\u0094 on that site instead of spending time reaching users for his product is an idiot.\"<p>I've been checking out these threads for a few days and have started leaving comments because that apparently gives you a better chance.  Paul has a lot of tough choices to make and I understand his reasons for using comments as one of the many tools in filtering prospective startups, but I really hope its a small small factor.  Sure it proves I read blogged advice and other mumbo jumbo on the subject of startups and am interested in the funding, but it also might indicate that a person has way too much free time or has a serious net addiction (a major development killer).  I've been getting ready to kick start my startup this summer for over a month now.  During that time I've read a lot of these startup articles, all of Paul's entries, Founders at Work, bought a few other books and searched the net for VC firms and how to get in touch with them.  One article at the beginning of the process affected me greatly.  When I was making the tough decision to do the startup or take a very appealing job offer I read Paul's article (not to brown nose) \"A student's guide to startups\" which said the best time to start one is when you're 24, fresh out of grad school, and hopefully have a solid internship behind you.  That was something I didn't know and hit me hard because this summer that will be my exact situation. If I hadn't have read it I might have missed my perfect window! I made my decision right then. Every article, book, or resource since however has been repetitive and more draining on my energy to get started than helpful.<p>My point, and the article's author's point in the quoted paragraph is, use these articles to get yourself inspired and confident about  doing this thing and then stop reading and commenting!  You're inspired now don't kill it and waste your time with reading more and more of the same crap, go make your own stories. This is most likely my last post here.  I hope that doesn't effect my rating :).\n",

It's basic Econ101 - these seed-funders are striving to meet a market demand that is far from being even close to being met given all those who are not accepted. I imagine and hope that even more will spring up so more guys can get the leg-up they may need. <p>Not everyone can be a Stanford or Harvard - but that doesn't mean there aren't other very good schools that are a better fit for many students.",

                "text": "The evolution of the Internet is constantly being challenged by creationists-Its sort of brilliant marketing (Komisar) to act as though as of your investees has a great idea it warrants another web phase (3.0?). True, no product campaign these days is complete without a rebranding of the web itself. <p>As advertising has undergone a power shift, from the content providers to the users, advertising has somehow become a bad word. Now that end users decide what and how products will be pitched, advertising seems to stand not only for traditional, flashy, in-your-face ads, but for any product communication that has already occurred. In that sense,  advertising is perpetually over, and therefore always omnipresent.  <p>Simply put, as more and more people research products and services online, making purchasing decisions online, and actually buy online, it seems preposterous to claim that advertising, and companies that are in the business of advertising, are in anyway passe. It is inconsistent with the evolution of the web. <p>What I like about Komisar-backed Aggregate Knowledge is that it is creating the platform for some wonderful advertising streams. Right now, as I understand it, they are touting as part of their product targeting by the Psychology of Crowds, or the beginning of building psychological profiles of buyers. This is done on many shopping sites: If person 1 buys product A, then he will, based on group research, be interested in product B and product C and should be presented with B and C in a non-obtrusive fashion.  \nWhat this should naturally evolve into is a better targeting-being able to differentiate between types of buyers; is she an impulse buyer that might be wooed by a flashy interface, or is she a research shopper, who needs a case study to buy? Merely providing relevant content, without the proper packaging for the individual (what I think to be the advertising formerly know as advertising) is deficient.   \nAlso, what is the ideal interface complexity of this shopper? For instance, in person people buy less in big stores because they are overwhelmed by the sheer number of options. They are more likely to buy products in a smaller store. People are more influenced by items placed at the front of the store as their shopping goals are more malleable as they enter. Not to say that these findings will translate directly to shopping behavior on the web, but we will soon have the ability to create the perfect shopping environment for an individual, and advertising will be big part of it. \n",

A corollary is to ask, what can a user do with my product that he can't do without it? The answer to these questions should be a single, simple, focused answer.<p>2. What is the absolute minimum feature set we must have in order for the product to do what the user needs? Question EVERYTHING. If you're designing an email product, ask yourself if you even need folders. If you're designing a MS Word killer, ask yourself if you even need a Save. If you're designing a media player, ask yourself if even need a play/pause button.<p>After you have the minimum feature set, release the software and iterate quickly based on user feedback. Nothing can replace raw feedback from strangers who don't give a crap about you or your product. See what the users like and dislike about the product, based on first hand observation. <p>More tricky is keeping the product simple in response to user feature demands. Adding features is good, but only when you do it in such a way that it complements your answer to the original question: \"What is the product supposed to do?\" <p>You have to think about how each and every additional feature deeply integrates into your existing product, rather than tacking features on haphazardly. This is difficult to do. Google does this especially well (Search, Gmail).",

By announcing that they were giving back money to their shareholders, they opened the door for savvy stock market gurus.  These guys milked it for all it was worth by first loading up on the stock in order to get the cash from the dividends.  Because all these people were buying the stock, its price became artificially inflated, so they proceeded to borrow against the stock at this point (in order to short-sell later).  Then the dividends came, and they got the $3/share from Microsoft.  Immediately after this, they proceeded to sell the stocks that got them the dividends, which led to the stock price falling sharply.  Finally, to round it all out, they proceeded to make good on the short-sells once the stocks were low, leading to a nice profit all-around.<p>I wish I remembered where I read about this scheme; it sounded pretty brilliant to me.  I always wondered, though, if a bunch of people playing the stock market profited from this, who lost out?  I guess the long-time shareholders and Microsoft, itself.",

Honestly, I am not trying to sound cute here but if you are the kind who has been PLANNING to start a startup for months now then NOW is the time to do it.<p>You don't need to do ANY further reading on HOW TO start a start-up. Provided you know what you are building, get working on the ACTUAL start-up rather than worrying too much about funding. <p>There are people on the other end of spectrum too that start too many startups. I was on that end and had to conciously control my urge to start new things and focus on one thing. A lot of you guys here though that have been THINKING about a start-up for months now just need to do it!<p>1. Call a meeting of your partners to finalize what product you are building; PIN DOWN who will use it; have SOME idea how you will get users<p>2. Have another meeting and sketch out all the functions<p>3. Start coding; set tight deadlines<p>One thing that might help is to start thinking of what you are doing not in terms of a start-up but as a product. When we say start-up we associate with it all the luggage of fund raising etc. but when you are just building a product it is a very specific goal you are after.<p>Good luck!<p>-Zaid\n",

                "text": "Hilarious! Yes, I have seen this <i>way</i> too many times. Great find!<p>Here's a personal account of ball of mud code: <p>(from my comment on <a href=\"http://blogs.smugmug.com/don/2007/04/07/how-to-wreck-your-brand/\">http://blogs.smugmug.com/don/2007/04/07/how-to-wreck-your-brand/</a> )<p>I worked with them [Sony] on the development of their <a href=\"http://musicstore.connect.com/\">http://musicstore.connect.com/</a> site that was their attempted 'iTunes Store killer' (just saying that makes me chuckle). Wow, what a mess. Talk about spaghetti code that had mushroomed into a giant ball of mud. It was <i>way</i> over budget and took much longer than anyone anticipated. And a year later, it still only supports Internet Explorer and Windows.<p>My take on what went wrong in this instance: they did not manage complexity.<p>They let it grow and grow and did not believe that 'code debt' was a reality. It soon took 10 times longer to make even the simplest changes because of the very poor state of the code.<p>I have seen this happen at several companies and it's usually the same story. There are B and C level coders that don't understand the dangers or code complexity or code debt and thus create loads of both. The A level coders that do understand this try to explain the growing problem to management. The management doesn't know any better, so they see code cleanup as a needless expense that will only slow down rolling out new features and so they side with the B and C level coders. Of course, the irony is that development will eventually crawl to a near halt because the code is undecipherable. Along the way the A level coders get so frustrated with the state of the code base that they leave the company for greener pastures. This is the critical turning point since the B and C level coders will only hire other B and C level coders - and the project will die a slow death as the cycle continues.",

GoDaddy is not a startup, it is now a pretty large company and anyone who has money to throw around on Super Bowl commercials certainly isn't a little guy.<p>Second, GoDaddy and SalesGenie have nothing to do with each other. GoDaddy sells domain names, SalesGenie deals with businesses needing sales leads. While it is silly that they didn't test in Firefox, their market probably doesn't use Firefox that much. I'm willing to bet that 99% of their customers use IE so it really doesn't matter that much.<p>Third, the number of people who actually know who Kevin Rose is or can recognize him is very small relatively. So while including him in their commercial might get a lot of webbies talking about it, it won't have any effect on the vast majority of their potential customers.<p>This article made a lot of apples to oranges comparisons.<p>\n",

You build a company on relationships and the key influencer's leave and your user base is eroded. So just who is Jaiku? <p>I ran into Jaiku [0] after listening to Bruce Stirling. Bruce is a science fiction writer, appeared on the first cover of Wired and writes in his blog, <i>beyond the beyond</i> [1]. But I think he's a better orator than writer. Listening to a talk he gave at SWSX on ITConverstions [2], i found out about things like <i>spimes</i>, why the <i>'disembodied head of Alan Turing'</i> would be beaten by google and Thinklinks.<p>Thinklinks [3] allow you to locate physical things by a unique id on the Internet. The creator of Thinglinks is none other than Ulla-Maaria Mutanen [4], the other half of Jaiku creator, Jyri Engestrom [5].<p>What I've tried to demonstrate is the connected nature of communities. Any service that tries to harness their power of connections can be just as easily burnt. This episode shows demonstrates to me there is less loyalty to services than the social network you inhabit.<p>ps: news.yc can't handle unicode.<p>Reference<p>[0] Jaiku, Helsinki based , shared presence startup, 'About'<p><a href=\"http://jaiku.com/about\">http://jaiku.com/about</a><p>[1] Wired, Bruce Strirling blog, 'beyond the beyond'<p><a href=\"http://blog.wired.com/sterling/\">http://blog.wired.com/sterling/</a><p>[2] ITConversations, 'Bruce Stirling, The Internet of Things, 58m, 26.4 mb, 2006MAR06'<p><a href=\"http://www.itconversations.com/shows/detail717.html\">http://www.itconversations.com/shows/detail717.html</a><p>[3] Thinklink, 'locate physical things by computers.

                "text": "There were some mistake submissions which got deleted from the front page. They were immediately obvious as mistakes, but what if a dupe was submitted a week later? a month later? ten years later? A dupe may leave and re-enter relevance given the circumstances. In a different context, a dupe may not be a dupe, even if it references the same information.<p>For the last two cases I saw, \"delete me\" works, but I find this self-policing idea suboptimal. There will inevitably be users in the future who make mistake submissions. If they are completely irrelevant, or carbon copies, fine. But if they are submissions like \"AMAZING PHOTO!\", what if the user finds it personally significant? As the size of the crowd grows, no matter how focused your initial crowd is, or how you intially positioned your product, there will be a scattering of interest. Unless you follow an editor and moderator model, slashdot for example, you will be unable to filter your content to a specific standard. In the case of an open-participation community, enforcing focus may be excessive: after all, the community is defined by itself, not the application it uses. If you gather more and more forgetful users, they may appreciate dupes.<p>After you hit some sort of critical mass of users, many new users will arrive by friend recommendations, or mere interest in the community size, rather than independent discovery. Independent users join after searching for and spotting something tailored to their specific interests, but there is no guarantee that referred users fall under the same profile.<p>In interest of monetization, it should be hard for popular sites to escape changing to accomodate a more diverse userbase. I believe this has hit both digg and reddit. Sooner or later, with the rapid growth seen here, news.yc also (which seems to evolve faster than the other news sites). In this regard, plus 1 for slashdot model (editors plus moderators). python_kiss also observed this on his project (interested in your thoughts). This also makes me question the strategy of pre-defining and then trying to self-enforce a niche in an open and user-driven website. Of course you can use subgroupings by topic, or do something like Ning, but lurkers that never bother to customize their preferences, whose numbers are probably significant, will be hard to please. You might even have better luck with them by showing random stories than by showing the most popular or most active.<p>Maybe the popularity measure has shown its limit in usefulness. Users come for content quality, be that quality of information or emotion (flamewars give belligerent folks an adrenaline boost); the quality is driven by a few. I would come back here just to read the comments from a couple amazingly good commenters. Those comments could spawn complete discussions by themselves, like the questions from good panel moderators in conferences. More than popularity, then, the submission rating should be influenced more by the overall \"quality\" measure of the discussion. For example, in slashdot, you look at the number of comments, then the total number of, say, +5 comments. Usually it's something like, say, 10 percent. When it's significantly higher, I anticipate a good read.<p>That reminds me again. Topic Karma is an interesting attempt. python_kiss? :)",

I was like, yeah, the Nemo guy, I guess he's a writer... okay, so I didn't know his backstory with Pixar or anything about him and it just was an amazing interview to me.<p>Anyway, I wanted to explain the emphasis I put on just how much you want to really desire to create what you're making, to be dying to get it in front of people.  So here's the part I wanted to excerpt from the interview that really gives you folks in News.YC-land the sense of how driven you want to be:<p>---<p>Interviewer Andrew Gordon: What would you say is the hardest thing about directing an animated movie?<p>Andrew Stanton: The hardest thing about directing an <i>animated</i> movie is keeping yourself excited about it.  It's hard enough to make the crew excited about it, but keeping yourself excited about it -- trying to remind yourself why you wanted to do it.  Because it's all about the details once you really start making the movie.<p>It's no different than building a house, or, building a really extravagant mansion.  There's a million details that you have to spend more time with after the bigger ideas of where the rooms are going to go and how it's going to be structured, and it can get you kind of bogged down.<p>Joe Ranft used to have this great expression that there's always a point during the making of a movie where there's sort of the Columbus where-is-the-land moment, where everybody on the boat is going \"You promised us the land.  Where's the land?  We're not seeing it!\"<p>And people get bogged down in all the minor problems or the major problems that won't go away, and it's all justified -- it's all legitimate to have that response.<p>So, for me, to prevent that is to get really, really picky about what story you're going to tell up front.  And this is my opinion, and it's not a rule.  But if I have an idea that I kinda like, then I don't want to do it.  If I have an idea that affects every fiber of my being, like \"I want to see that movie made whether I make it or not\" -- it's like that idea <i>has</i> to get on the screen -- that's a real good quality to start with.  Because it's going to get attacked for the next four years.  And there's going to be, sometimes, weeks or months where nothing seems to be going right.<p>[...]<p>It's like looking for oil or something -- it's like \"where can I find something that has enough fuel that's going to keep me going for years?\"  Because there's going to large stretches of time where nothing is working, nobody's happy, everybody thinks that the sky is going to fall, and what's going to get me out of bed is just because that idea still <i>has</i> to be on the screen.<p>So I want that when I'm going to go into battle.  Because it's going to be battle.  So if I don't have that going in, then I won't go into it -- I won't make that movie.  And I'm starting to try and insist on that with other filmmakers here at Pixar, because I just know the benefits of it.",

I've been getting reports back about data + storage + access/retrieval [0]. My bet is something. There is an explosion of <i>data</i> occurring. The question is <p>- what types of data storage of the web going to be? <p>- what is the sql or retrieval method of the web? <p>- what are the tools to interact?<p>- what factors influence storage?<p>Also with storage it relies on bandwidth. What is the law on bandwidth? It's not like Moore`s law and relies on external forces beyond mere commodity markets.  Well luck has it that there's Nielsen`s law [1] describing the increase of bandwidth per year, around 50%. So Moore`s law is number of transistors doubling every 18 months with an increase of about 60% per year. So anything google do with BigData will depend to some degree on peoples access to bandwidth.  <p>What is google and others doing with bandwidth?<p>Reference<p>[0] Joe Gregorio, bitworking.org, 'ETech 07 Summary Part 2 MegaData'<p><a href=\"http://bitworking.org/news/158/ETech-07-Summary-Part-2-MegaData\">http://bitworking.org/news/158/ETech-07-Summary-Part-2-MegaData</a><p>[1] Jakob Nielsen, useit.com, 'Nielsen's Law of Internet Bandwidth,  5th April 1998'<p><a href=\"http://www.useit.com/alertbox/980405.html\">http://www.useit.com/alertbox/980405.html</a><p>",

Drawing with DHTML is really nothing new, but until recently you had to do it with tons of colored DIV tags.

I bet it will become a bit more useful once we fix some of the major issues people found yesterday, and add some new features to make it more suited to its intended task of team collaboration.<p>Anyway, I'd encourage folks to check back in a few weeks to see if we've made any progress.

I have been hearing for years about how lisp is really the ultimate programmers language. I respect this lisp-lover's oppinion and experience ultimately, and put him right in the list with Paul and Carl. So, 3 elite programmers who sing the graces of lisp. One was enough for me to want to learn to think in lisp. 3 in support should be a point to ponder.<p>The problem I have always encountered with trying to build a solution in lisp is the lack of resources. It sounds like lisp is inching closer and closer to the critical mass where tools and libraries will finally be available for more then a few uses.<p>This lisper I know said \"Don't hold your breath.\" when I suggested that lisp may be coming close to getting its due.  I know that there are alot of people out there like me. We will start using lisp when the great advantages of the language finally outweigh the disadvantages of implementation. I think its just a matter of time until lisp is a clear win, as long as the tools come.<p>I've never written a line of lisp. I want to save my lisp cherry for a time when I can have more \"Yay\" then \"Doh\" while I learn and use it. I think it will be worth the wait.",

Three years of law school in the US really doesn't teach you a whole lot - you learn everything on the job. You're basically paying for a law firm's reputation sometimes.<p>He's right, though - the best gauge for quality of service is experience. Get a lawyer with lots of experience in your area, or at least work with a boutique firm that specializes in your field. They will be expensive. Ask around first - other companies have a firm they work with, or in-house lawyers who can recommend a firm. Don't go with an asshole bigshot just because he has the experience - you're in the long haul with your lawyers, so make it pleasant as possible. Never forget that law is primarily a service industry, and he should be listening to you as well as offering advice. <p>The other side of the coin is this: don't hide anything from your lawyer. He can't save you from the pit you dug yourself if you don't tell him about it. You'll save yourself a lot in fees, believe me. ",

It is also quite true that hardware and stuff are quite cheap by now.<p>Still, if you don't have any money and not a job then VC seems to be the only way on how to make a living and pay for all the expenses. There are lawyer fees for getting incorporated, trademark-fees, patent-fees and renting a scalable RoR server at JoyEnt costs also 125$ a month. We are now a team of three founders and work fulltime on our project. But programming is only half the things we have to do, we also have to think about the promotion of our product, things have to be designed, the userinterface gets tested a lot and we have to think about strategies how to make our service known. We will probably use GoogleAdWords, create a viral videospot etc. All these things cost money. And it would be really great to have an office where we could program instead of my 13 squaremeter room which leaves me nearly no privacy because when I go to bed someone is programming in my apartment and when I wake up someone else is already there.<p>Therefore I think that VC still covers a quite basic need of a startup, even if RoR is used and the founders have read Getting Real. Founding a company still costs money, although admittedly less than a few years ago. VC-companies investing in webprojects are not dead, but will have to adapt to the needs of founders and start investing smaller sums.",

I'm currently of the opinion that we should live in my parents basement for the 3 months and not come out until we've got a beta to launch.  This way I can also take the last class I need to complete my masters and no money will be spent.  My partner is more of the opinion that we should move directly to SV.  Anyone with any experience or advice on this as we debate it out?  Also, I'll have to search this outsidethevalley.com more thoroughly but what does one do to get these one on one meetings with VCs?

Dell is more similar to Nike--neither manufactures anything.

Dell is not a technology company any more than Nike is one.  Dell does do simple assembly, but I don't think it's very technical stuff to put 7 components together on an assembly line.<p>HP is a tech company because they design printers and manufacture calculators.

                "text": "ABSOLUTELY!  The education system as we know it is a socialization process.  I makes mindless zombies very well but I fear that it swishes personalization and creativity in process.  Is it not a wonder that those kids who walk to the beat of their own drum in school becomes successful and those who always followed the rules become great paper pushers?  That's what school does, it teaches us to seek an approval that's external to us (ie. teacher's approval, grades, awards) and not a sense of internal approval (ie. pride, enjoyment, satisfaction).  We all get at least nearly 2 decades of this socialization process to be pounded into a mold (whether we're round, or rectangle or rhombus, we're all going into that square hole, because that's the only way to succeed in school, and if we don't, we're deemed a freak and forced to be medicated and the like).  It's that same mold that we must break free from if we're to draw into the inner creativity, that inner peace.  I think after we've done so, we'll all be a lot happier and much more productive.  --- Sorry for the ranting, it's a touchy subject. ",

Most people think they're competing against \"people who will rip me off as soon as I release my product\" which leads to conclusions of \"if I release on day X, I will be ripped off Y number of days later, so I should wait until Z, the perfect time, to release.\"  In fact, there's a higher chance that there are startups and current companies doing something similar REGARDLESS of YOU.<p>A lot of the reason existing companies have not caught on to idea X is because the whole reason you have idea Y is because the current companies just came out with idea X and there's simply no way to do Y before X.  So, they may have already had your idea Y in mind, or started working on it, but had to release X first.  So, when you got your idea, so did employees of all of these other companies, as well as budding entrepreneurs.  So, you should release and at least get credit for being first.  The whole point of being a startup is you can create whatever there's a huge chance big companies are working on as well, but much faster because you're just implementing basic features and avoiding bureacracy, as well as have no responsibilities.  So, if you're trying to do a startup PG-style, I would try to create it and release it as soon as it works, with the bare features in it, and get publicity about it.<p>I'm sure there are other mantras, like targeting a very small niche and improving the product, and only publicizing it when its ready (but you have tons of feedback from your small niche).  Or, maybe getting a lot of venture capital straight off and partnering with big shots after you're much older and have many contacts.  But I think if you're doing it PG-style (and I don't speak for him), you should release it as soon as it works.  More or less.",

The model and the site have gone through a complete overhaul over the past 6 months.   The new site just went live today.

Rejection from YC can mean that they don't think the project can succeed; it can also mean that they don't think the project, even if it succeeds, will give them the kind of return on investment they want.<p>So (to make the math easy) suppose they have a company that they own 10% of, that they've invested $15K in.  This means that for them to break even, the company has to eventually have a value of $150,000.  A rule of thumb for business valuation is that the sale price of the business is 3 to 5 times its annual earnings -- which means that the business has to earn $30,000 a year to $50,000 a year in profit for that to be worthwhile.<p>Now, a micro-ISV, for instance, that treats its founders' salaries (appropriately) as expenses may be a terrifically successful business from the point of view of the founders, especially if they pay themselves acceptably well and like the working conditions.  But unless it makes $30,000 to $50,000 in profits a year, it's a losing proposition for Y Combinator.<p>There are other ways it can be a winning proposition without those profits -- if it's just before the tipping point of a big trend, or if the founders are especially skillful.  A company that isn't making any profits at the moment but has the potential to make really big profits, or the potential to be sold for a lot of money, might be a worthwhile investment.",

Not sure yet whether the product should be targeted at professionals, consumers, institutions, or a combination of them.<p>Have done the startup thing before in the founder and CTO role (several rounds of funding then sold to a competitor). Therefore I have already made many of the usual first-time mistakes (e.g. taking co-founders' top education as a guarantee for startup skills, not firing people quickly enough, etc.) and can avoid them this time around =) My academic background is in economics (PhD thesis \"almost\" completed) and law, with strong CS and math skills.<p>What I can do: technology, legal, negotiation, strategy, foreign markets, know how to get funding<p>Quirks to be aware of: do not believe in decision by consensus, follow libertarian ideals, unable to work effectively with mediocre people (with the realization this would often be useful)<p>Your qualities: <p>- integrity, perseverance, gets stuff done, can sleep well while taking risks<p>- some of the following skills: finance, PR, hiring, business development, design, technology; industry experience in gambling/betting or financial trading would also be beneficial<p>I believe I can handle technology and organization management pretty well, therefore I am mostly looking for someone who likes handling external relations and is also a people person (i.e. can focus on keeping everyone happy inside the company). This is not written in stone however.<p>Technologies: <p>- backend: FP (ML variants, Erlang) with some C++, message-passing concurrency, PostgreSQL, cluster protocols, looking into stream processing; all on Unix like systems<p>- frontend: <p>(1) web: html+comet/ajax, flash<p>(2) client: C#+WinForms prototype, maybe ML+SDL/OpenGL later if that makes correctness easier to achieve<p>(3?) mobile: J2ME?<p>Location: UK or Gibraltar ideal for a number of reasons but open to locating the business somewhere else if for good reasons<p>Funding: self-funded for now, the plan is to do a single round in the GBP 500k-1m range with private investors at (hopefully) a ~5m valuation; revenue should sustain growth from there; ideally I would like to make a trade sale within a 3-5 yrs time span.<p>Contact me at ffmmuu(at)gmail.com to discuss!",

Try again for Winter with a different idea or more code and a better presentation.  Or apply for a job at an existing startup.  Some of the WFP guys are hiring (Parakey, Zenter, and a few others) as are the Xobni guys from last years progem--all are wicked smart, have lined up some funding, and would be very helpful to you in your goal of becoming an entrepreneur.<p>If, on the other hand, you've already written mumble-thousand LoC, and you are within a couple of months of launching, and you really believe in your idea and product, contact some other angels and seed investors.  They exist.  They aren't as cool as YC, but they have money and they have connections, too.  As a last resort, if you're in the wrong city for raising money (anything other than Silicon Valley or Boston), warm up your credit card and give it a go.  You can live for three months on a credit card (I've done it several times...I'm on my second company, the first being self-funded and sometimes credit card funded).  Obviously, if you've got a family to support the \"warm up your credit card\" method of funding is right out.  Otherwise, just keep your health insurance current, pay your taxes, and live on nothing but ramen and buy nothing between now and launch day.<p>If your project is too big to launch in that short time, then that's why you were rejected by YC.  Winnow it down to the smallest piece that has value and launch.  Our project (Virtualmin) was huge (several hundred thousand lines of code, by the time you factor in Webmin and Usermin).  But we were already selling product, and figured we were within a couple of months of \"finishing\" the beta period (we were off by a little bit, as we're still a couple of weeks away from wrapping it up six months later--partly because of the major strategy shifts we made during WFP2007).",

                "text": "1. Offer money.  Seriously, if you need someone to design your web application or do your accounting, don't be too cheap about it.  Freelancers are professionals and need income like everybody else.  You may not be able to offer market rates, so do what you can in-house, and make reasonable offers for the things you need to outsource.<p>2. Beg for favors from family and friends.  With people you know well, you <i>can</i> get away with asking for favors for little or no remittance.  It becomes a team effort.  Of course, your friends' goodwill is a limited resource.  Spend it wisely.  If a graphic designer friend makes a logo for your company, and you lose interest two weeks later, she won't be as willing to help on your next project.<p>3. Be persuasive.  There are great ways to get people to help you out, and you can learn to pitch your request so that it sounds better than \"just based on promises.\" ;-)  I'm not an expert on this, but two books that get rave reviews are \"The Psychology of Persuasion\" and \"Getting to Yes\".  You can persuade people to help you out if you know how to ask.  Make it a win-win situation.<p>I don't suggest offering equity to contractors right off the bat.  A friend who will work for equity will probably also work for free, with just a few tokens of your appreciation.  And if you're asking someone to do so much work that they <i>need</i> some compensation, maybe they should be a co-founder?<p>Nor do I suggest getting services on loan.  (\"We'll pay you once we're funded.\")  Investors want you to use their capital to do new work and achieve new milestones, not pay off old debt.  Employees get impatient when they're owed money.  And if you never get funding, it pretty much impedes any ongoing relationship with these people.<p>Hope this helps -- good luck!",

There's a very good reason why it's often referred to as \"runway.\"<p>The number one motivating factor for startups and the reason why they're able to operate more efficiently than larger competitors boils down to one thing: desperation.  Having limited resources makes you desperate and hungry.  Besides, living in a cramped apartment and eating ramen is a good reminder of what you get when you don't win (and having a roof over your head ain't too bad).<p>Paying yourselves $300K when you guys probably don't have revenue is a great way to mislead your investors, create politics amongst employees, and, most of all, make you complacent.<p>Now, (mis)using investors' money to live the life isn't unheard of.  I once interned at a company that basically lost hundreds of millions of dollars every year and addressed this by systematic studio closures and layoffs.  The company's misfortunes resulted from poor oversight by the management team and had almost nothing to do with those being laid off (they all went on the be headhunted by competing firms).  Following suit, every year, product-producing employees were let go while executives maintained their $400K salaries.  The management team basically did whatever they could to keep the company alive while they drew as much salary as possible.  Interestingly enough, this behavior actually began when they got funded in the late 1980s.\n",

For most of the typical Web 2.0 stuff getting built these days, huge spikes in traffic are exactly what you want, but using Rails is setting you up to have scaling issues once you get the press you're hoping for. You're likely to run into those same issues regardless, but why make things worse? Assuming Rails is better than Django, it's not so much better that it'll make up for the poor performance. The improvements in ease of development aren't unique to Rails, they're a byproduct of the philosophy that Django, Rails, and similar frameworks all share.<p>I'm far more likely to trust the opinion of the Twitter folks than that of people who have something to gain from my choice of framework.",

It's a very strange sensation and I wouldn't recommend doing it too often (maybe even check with a doctor first).  Generally, after about 5-10 minutes, I feel very similar to the way I feel when working out, except without the sweat, elevated heart rate, and muscle strain.<p>It's not exactly practical to swim 20 laps then sit down and do some design or development, even if you could bring your laptop to the pool.<p>But yeah, metacognition techniques are basically metaprogramming for your brain.",

In those moments, I'm not really seeing anything (exception noted above) but my mind is just cranking on something.  After a few of these sessions (the quantity varies on how complex the problem is I'm currently working on) I get the Aha! moment.<p>So I guess the skill is to be able to reduce conscious focus to free up access to your subconscious at opportune times.  In my college days, I used to do this at inopportune moments, such as driving home.  On several occasions, I would drive right by my apartment and basically start getting lost before realizing I had been in \"subconscious\" mode and had no idea where I was going.<p>An excellent way to access your subconscious is hard-core exercise.  I've had the experience when swimming many laps, biking up a mountain, or cross-country skiing where I hit \"the zone\", the moment when your body is taking you with very little mental effort.  That is when the subconscious flys and you can really solve some of the hardest problems.<p>I think sleep-deprivation is also a way to reduce conscious focus.  I've hatched many integrations when running on too little sleep.  There is the \"sleeper's high\"  period which is especially good for subconscious work.  Beware, however, of the big low you can get afterward.  Push it too far, and you can get downright depressed.  My record to date is 72 hours of focused work with very few breaks.  I would have made it even longer if I hadn't bent over to tie my shoes after a shower - I woke up several hours later. (The good old college days.)  The key to surviving the sleep deprivation lows is to work on really exciting and inspirational problems.",

I have used alchohol to get some creative brainstorming done.  Yoga and Bhuddism have centuries of tradition centered around exploring the subconscious.<p>People can learn to meditate.  Brain scans of people who just learned \"fixed point meditation\" (where you stare at a dot and tune out your environment) showed up nearly identical to experienced practitioners.  The only difference was that the inexperienced people couldn't hold the meditation for very long.  But they appeared to be doing it right.

Looking back at how discussion systems evolved over the years, it's easy to see that small steps have been taken to improve the user experience be enforcing an overall higher quality of content.<p>Since users shape the community, you have two choices in dealing with an evolving site: keep your initial vision by implementing rules and potentially alienating certain user groups; or letting your site adapt to the users. Both are valid approaches. Slashdot takes the former, because it has moderators, and digg takes the latter, so it's userbase keeps growing while the quality keeps dropping. I imagine reddit would take the latter path too. news.yc is also facing the same kind of change. Recalling the bunch of \"delete me\" posts last week, it seems like quality control is done mostly by self-policing of some sort.<p>It's an issue of how much control and what tastes the users have, and what mechanisms have been implemented to strengthen or weaken the expression these tastes in the system. Most discussion sites fall into two extremes. Total moderator control, or total user control. A very powerful alternative doesn't simply lie in the middle; it shifts back and forth.

In other words, you can incorporate anywhere you wish and its legitimate- the act of incorporation creates the domicile for the business. <p>If you're going to do business in Japan to the point that you have above ground employees (taxes, social security, etc.) then you'll have to find out the Japanese laws. Even then it probably makes sense to incorporate outside of Japan for tax reasons.   A foriegn corporation operating in a country is generaly treated differently (and better) than a domestic corporation.<p>But, if not, then you can incorporate in any jurisdiction which is friendly to corporations.<p>I would strongly recommend you do not incorporate in the US.  The USA is not a friendly jurisdiction for corporations and all the trends are that it is getting worse.  Ths US has enacted currency controls, limiting ones ability to move money in and out of the country-- this is the first step in the creation of an \"iron curtain\".  (Requiring passports of people who travel, as the US started doing in January is the second step.) <p>It is only appropriate to incorporate in america if your business is completely located in america.  (If you want to find out what your government does all day, just file business papers in many states- over the next 6 weeks you'll get contacted by many dozens of different agencies, all of whom want you to do paperwork and give them money. Texas is an exeption to this, Nevada may be as well.) <p>Ok, on to the real advice-- look at countries that are pro-business, or who are, or used to be tax havens.  The caymen islands and bahamas are obvious choices, but also st kitts and nevis are worth checking out.  You can legally incorporate there.  Some of these islands have restrictions about the business you can operate there, but are happy to incorporate foriegn businesses (that is to say, its easier if you'll not be opening an office on their soil).<p>Along those lines- ex UK protectorates, consider the Isle of Man (or is it the Isle of Wight?) and closer to home, New Zealand and Australia.  These latter two are high tax states, but are closer and may prove to be good choices for you. <p>Also consider the united arab emerites, monaco and Mauritius.  These are a different style, but they may prove to be good places.<p>Finally, probably the best place to incorporate is Panama.  Their government is oriented around providing services to foriegn industry... starting with the canal, but also ships registry, bank registration, incorporation and trust services, etc.  This is probably one of the easiest places to do it.<p>If you're planning to bank outside of Japan, you might consider incorporating in Switzerland, so that your corporation and your bank can have closer ties.  But I haven't looked into that much. <p>Its hard to find good information on this subject, probably because US courts have thrown people in jail for giving \"Advice on how to avoid US taxes\"... so, while this isn't a tax dodge (you're not a US citizen) people are wary of talking about it.<p>",

There are little things that bugged me like the clunky spell check,  the lame privacy details that don't let you remove your documents (even if you leave) the monitoring of your documents. If you upload a file (in my case a OpenOffice doc) it misses grabbing the title from the document itself.  They also missed the <i>print</i> functionality. I don't want to download a doc to have to print it. [0]<p>If you've created a document and want to edit with others it looks ok. I <i>did</i> like the way the worked with the screen (lots of whitespace), revised documents, the input parser for various documents, the atom feed. The fact you could export the data in various formats and support for UTF-8.  I missed the point of it being a collaborative blog tool.  That certainly is a useful feature but not a killer.<p>Then I took into account the fact it's a new product. Bare minimum to get launched. It's not going to be used for corporates for security & privacy reasons.  But if you have to create something with someone else in a different location it will get usage.<p>That's from a user perspective. From an application perspective it's slick & I wonder how they got such a service up and running so fast. [1]  It does not take the radical steps of say Rael's stickit, [2] making little affordances as the user enters data, remembering it and getting the application to help you. [3]  I also miss an API. But it's early days.<p>I wonder how they intend to make money off it? Expanded functionality, number of documents you can create, edit.

                "text": "Interesting point.  I agree that the biggest procrastination inducing disincentive to <i>starting</i> creative work is the preconception in the creator's mind that \"this will be a great thing - I will make it perfect\", etc.  I learned while designing in architectural school that the key to good design was to strip away all preconceptions about a problem before starting - which is dramatically harder than it sounds.  The preconception of a quest for perfection before starting is the most important one.<p>However, once you have \"programmed\" your conscious mind with the problem, allowed your subconscious to crunch on it and give you the first draft of a solution to the problem, the quest for making it as good as possible is key to actually having it be good.  With that first solution, you can then refine it, with the idea of making it increasingly better. The question then is when do you stop (or go live) - a very important point.   The beauty of web development is that you can think of the project as an evolution toward being very good from somewhat humble beginnings.  This makes it that much easier to come to the good-enough point faster than in the past stand-alone application days, but then continue improving as long as the project continues to be exciting.  The \"lets make it better\" drive is a really important motivator, at least it is for me.\n",

My primary advice for a startup office space: buy DOORS for desks!.  You can get doors at home depot for desks - hollow core nice wood without the door handles drilled out for just over $10 apiece.  Put the doors on top of file cabinets, and voila, you have a nice looking desk at very low cost that can last for years if you like.):<p>From the hackers perspective:<p>+Each space had to have natural light and views, but be closable for privacy.  The point here is to allow for staring into the distance when the subconscious is cranking on an idea, allow the space to be closed during moments of extreme focus, and to have the doors be a sign to others which mode the person is in at the time.<p>+Each space had to allow for a small conference of 2-3 people for easy and impromptu discussions.<p>+Each space had to have a lot of attention to detail and materials to make the spaces feel personal.<p>+There had to be a space for larger meeting outside of the formal business conference room.  I turned the lunch-room into one of the key design spaces and put whiteboards all along one wall with data ports for easy discussions and to make having lunch more fun.  (The company provides free lunch every day)<p>+The developer area had to be acoustically protected from the back office area, the customer relations area and the accounting area to avoid concentration disruptions.<p>+The space was in a classic old building with exposed wood beams and ceilings, so we used a raised floor system (with no sign to the user that it's raised) to have all the heating/cooling provided from the floor and allow for easy addition and movement of data and power ports.<p>+The server room was treated as a \"jewel\" with wall to wall glass for people (especially hackers) to appreciate the racks of technology at their fingertips.  (Also, the servers had multiple power back up systems including generators, a fire suppression system that would not damage the equipment in case it was used, and its own cooling system to run at ideal temperatures with a lot of extra rack space to allow for easy growth.)<p>From Management's Perspective:<p>+The space had to be flexible to allow for reconfiguration and potentially moving out to another space in the future.<p>",

My thinking was that the people we typically think of as smart are the people who are innovative and come up with new ideas. And new ideas tend to come from combining two or more fields.

Or quitting your day job and doing something so outrageous to make sure you will never ever get employed again (can't even imagine what that would be)? The latter would be kind of stupid, but quitting your day job doesn't seem so bad. Don't they say that younger people can afford to take more risks in their investments, because if they fail, they have enough time to make up for it? That seems sensible to me - I think it is far more dangerous to not take any risks and then regret it later when it is (seemingly) too late, like when you have a family support. <p>So no, I don't think I agree with that article at all.\n",

But there are small things that pisses me off.\"<p>I've like 7 years of experience with real development. From perl procedural coding without any framework to Objective C (to show the more bizarre language I've worked). I developed (not alone) a simple and small perl framework that is being used on iJigg and due to my experience what I can say is:<p>You have to choose the language and framework that will suit  your application needs.<p>If your application will change everyday don't go for java or C, use these easy to change/handle languages like perl, python, php.<p>If your application deals a lot with IO and disk usage go for C, C++, Objective C.<p>If you have many programmers you need something like Java, that IMHO is good because people will code only what you let them code. A good programmer will make the same code as a beginner one. I always thought that Java was made for mass production.<p>About frameworks, you don't need them if you have something as simple as www.thankyou2006.com.<p>Frameworks are great, I couldn't live without them when building complex applications but there are many traps when using them. The learning curve and the freedom to hack it.<p>This comment is already too big, I've to write something more elaborated.\n",

I just Google it.<p>Yes, I know there's a bunch of opinion/review sites out there but they all suck and are fairly biased due to spam.<p>A big issue is that most of the products on specialized review sites are highly polarized... either highly negative or highly positive. Dissatisfied people, overwhelingly, seem to have enough incentive to go and review (negatively) a product. Most of the people who are satisfied are content with that and don't feel the need to waste their time and review. On the other end, highly elated people are inclined to review positively a product. So in the end, most of these voluntary review sites suck. The only reviews I trust almost completely are Consumer Reports reviews. They are impeccable and free of bias.",

In a way it still serves mostly the same niche, except that the niche it attacked proved to be extremely large, popular, and profitable.<p>If Virb is marketed as a MySpace killer, it's entering crowded arena and cannot escape a feature-by-feature comparison with MySpace. Assuming they are trying to grab defects from MySpace, it seems reasonable to sport a features galore -- as long as MySpace users can feel right at home. If they want blinky text, they got it. Embedded music? Got it. Want more than MySpace? Have more than MySpace. Stuff like that.<p>That said, I think it's more about being clear about your target market and your product goals. Considering iJigg though, I am not so sure about aiming for a similar userbase is what you meant by \"similar goals\". The reason I bring this up is because I'm interested in how you are planning the next steps for your product. I'm nobody to give suggestions here, but I would be cautious about aligning myself with Virb if that's what you're talking about.",

Because if you're using a text editor like emacs, programming in Java can seem ridiculously difficult.  Conversely it might seem ridiculously difficult for a person accustomed to an IDE to use a text editor for a scripting language.<p>Coding Java without an IDE is like trying to control the space shuttle with a steering wheel.  Once you've mastered all the features of an IDE, however, (which can take years, but then again so does learning emacs) programming in Java becomes a breeze and you get all the benefits of static typing (with the safety and tools it enables) and the vast Java libraries with no extra difficulty coding compared to a simpler language.",

What should non-registering users be able to do?<p>The alternatives I can think of are:  Have a set of &#42;.try.foo.com sites that they can play around with and reset them to sane defaults occasionally.  Or, let them nab the site name of their choice but warn them it gets deleted unless they register within 24 hours.  Either way, I'd like to avoid site names getting used up for no good reason.

Similarly, the 500GB SATA drives are a much better deal than the 750+GB drives. Be careful when you spec. the boxes because if you don't specify that you're going to e.g., load them up with additional drives later, the builders will spec them with the smaller/cheapest controller they can.<p>If all of the data can be handled locally then you definitely don't have a lot of data. :-).

I am under the impression that 10gigE with TCP/UDP offload is pretty similar to 10gb Myrinet.<p>Lots of calculation and data, hence the request for lots of CPU and RAM.  Storage is RAM binary-dumped to flat files (snapshots), so standard hard drives are fine.  Intra-cluster: preferably 10gigE but multiple 1gigE might work.  Net connectivity would probably be okay with 1gigE (total).<p>I can probably do some lower-end testing on Sun's compute grid, but real-world testing needs real-world hardware.

And, the cover does not scream \"youth magazine\" to me.  So, I don't think it was politics that doomed this venture.<p>Youth today can get direct one-on-one interaction with people their own age on social networking sites.  NOw, compare and contrast the magazine with MTV in the 80's.<p>MTV made it easy to see concerts across the country and internationally.  They banded the youth together.  They were about music that you could hear and bands you could see.<p>This magazine is supposed to be about music, but youth can hear actual music in the profiles of their MySpace friends.  They don't need to trust an opinion of an older editor.  The magazine cannot play music.  It's a pain to flip through magazines if you're left-handed.<p>Do you really need a magazine to tell you, even if it's an accurate report, about the type of music people are listening to, when you can go and see what your friends are into, or see the top downloaded tracks in iTunes, and that's all that matters, really?",

I don't even know how it is called, but there is this kind of plastic coating for paper that consists of stripes of lenses, so that you see something different on the paper depending on the angle you look at it from (usually this is used on cheap gadgets for children). It turns out you can create pictures for that at home, at least a popular computer magazine claimed so some time ago and explained how to do it.<p>Being into games design at the time, I dreamed about showing an animation on my business card (a flying space ship, or space invaders perhaps?). In the end I was unable to find that plastic coating anywhere (I gave up too soon), and abandoned the idea. <p>Maybe I should pick it up again, but then again business cards seem also a bit yesterday. My second favorite design from ideo is the device that scans the business card and then burns it on the spot ( ;-) <a href=\"http://www.ideo.com/identity/cardpyre.htm\">http://www.ideo.com/identity/cardpyre.htm</a> ) ",

Your ownership of that is property you have EARNED. <p>When you take VC money, they get a percentage of the company, and your ownership is diluted, but at the same time the value of the company goes up, as it now has more cash assets in the bank.  The end result is immediately post money the value of your shares should be about the same as pre-money, only the ownership percentage of the company is less. <p>This is fair, and this is the consideration you  give up in exchange for their investment.<p>However, if they ask you to also re-vest your shares, are asking you to give up you property (and your voting power) in the hope that you will \"Earn them back\"... which first assumes you hav eto earn them (eg: it is a losss of property if you don't own it anymore) and secondly assumes that they won't have pushed you out.  While your shares are vesting you can't vote them, which gives the VC even more power.<p>Finally, they are not giving you consideration for these shares you're putting in jeapardy and so they are simply asking you to give them something for nothing.  The investment they are making is already paid for by you in the dilution you are experiencing.<p>There is absolutely no reason for a founders shares to re-vest.  <p>If your ownership in the company is not enough to ensure your interests are aligned with the VCs (Who really can't do much to make the company do well, but you can.) then the VCs wouldn't be investing-- period.  So the alignment of ownership excuse is patently absurd. <p>No reputable VC will ask you to vest your shares.  Only a thief would do that-- you own the shares, and asking you to give them up for nothing is trying to take advantage.<p>If a VC wants to put you on a vesting schedule to keep you incentivized.... let him offer you shares out of his pool to vest into.<p>Anything else is exceedingly greedy on the part of the VC.",

                "text": "Via Reddit.<p>I submitted this because the incentives are very similar to those involved in startup equity, and the resulting proportions are roughly the same.  Startups must choose how to divide the pot (i.e. equity) with each new hire.  Each employee can then a.) accept the proportion, working hard to make the startup succeed or b.) reject it, slack off, and make them <i>all</i> walk the plank.  There's another complication in that a pirate's coworker may catch him at b.) and tattle, forcing him and just him to walk the plank.<p>Why does this work like the pirate game, where only the senior pirate walks the plank?  Well, think about why the senior pirate ends up with all the loot.  It's because he's able to play the remaining pirates off each other: he can get away with offering 0 to pirate B, because he knows that B will be outvoted by the pirates that B is about to screw over.  Similarly, a shirking employee is \"outvoted\" by his peers in a startup, who stand to gain handsomely (even if the founders take the lion's share) if the startup succeeds.  They have a strong incentive to tattle on any shirker, which forces the shirker to work hard or get nothing.  0.1% of the company is a lot more than 0, even if the founder gets 50%.<p>This game also explains a lot of other accumulated startup wisdom, such as:<p>Why founders typically own 10-25% of the company each, while individual employees start at 1.5% of the company and decrease exponentially.  Each new employee has decreasingly less ability to make the whole company walk the plank, and so the founders can get away with giving up less equity.<p>Why your first 10 employees are the most critical hires, and should be self-motivated hackers who want to see the startup succeed for its own sake.  At this point, the startup has little peer pressure: if the founders are off negotiating a business deal, there's nobody to tattle on the workers, so if the founders own 80% of the company and each worker owns 1%, there's a strong incentive for them to goof off en masse.  If, however, you have 10 people that don't care that the founders are making 10 times as much as them, then they will tattle on the next 10 hires that want to shirk, letting you give those hires very little equity.<p>Why tolerating a single shirker often kills the whole startup.  Employees see that they will not lose their 0.1% if they shirk, and they figure that working hard so that the founders get 90% of the reward isn't worth it.<p>Why big companies are incapable of getting anything done.  As the company grows and equity gets diluted, the options granted to any one employee become minuscule.  Thus, employees have more to gain by making friends with their fellow shirkers than turning them in and boosting the stock price, and a culture of mediocrity settles in.<p>Why certain big companies have managed to avoid this.  There are two basic approaches, carrot and stick.  The \"stick\" approach is used by Intel and GE, and consists of firing the bottom 10% every year.  Employees figure that $60K salary is better than $0 salary, even if they aren't sharing in the company upside while the CEO makes $100M.  Unfortunately, this approach often means the company loses out on promising new hires who don't want to work in this environment.  The choice for them isn't $60K or $0, it's $60K and the constant threat of being fired or $55K and decent working conditions.<p>The \"carrot\" approach is to give really generous cash bonuses for performance - often 2-3x the normal salary.  This is used by Nucor and Goldman Sachs.  Employees will not only work hard if it means the difference between $40K and $130K, but they're more likely to tattle on underperforming peers who bring their group productivity down.",

These are companies that won big with only 1-5 people. I've been involved with startups that focused on getting a good series-A, hiring 20-30 people, then fucked around for 3 years and vanished off the face of the earth.<p>At this point, i think a better approach is to stay small and cash out for $10M in 18 months, rather than try to get big with an increasingly diminishing chance of success.<p>Of course if you're sure you've got a Google or YouTube, the \"traditional\" silicon valley venture-backed startup isn't a bad way to go. However it is kind of a bummer when you sell your thing for $1.4 billion and 600 million of it goes right to your investors... Would rather be Justin Frankel than Chad Hurley.",

Evolution favors the organism most responsive to change; thus, one must recognize conditions how they are, instead of operating from a mental model of how they were, to increase one's chances.<p>It's <i>always</i> relative; a combination of idea and environment.  The mistake is, when something doesn't work out, that we are tempted to say that the idea must be a bad idea.  The correct inference is that the combination of the idea and that particular environment did not work.<p>The corresponding mistake is to assign blame to the environment and say the environment is just bad for everything.  Note that hardly anyone makes <i>that</i> mistake -- instead, they say, \"the environment isn't <i>ready</i> for this idea <i>yet</i>\", noting that change is inevitable.<p>Another way of stating this is that the author failed to investigate <i>why</i> something was problematic.  Instead, it's as if he was operating blindly; \"I got burned by X, so in the future I will avoid X, because X burns.\"  That's somewhat like a child bumping into a kitchen table and getting mad at the table.  \"Tables are a problem -- let's get rid of them.\"\n",

Because it is most likely that they have everything I want.

So, even your aunts diner that is opening soon is a startup.<p>But when we talk about a \"startup\" here generally we're talking about a technology startup, or mroe specifically, a web oriented technology startup.<p>But we're not necessarily talking about: Funding, organization, theoretical growth rates, etc, for that company.<p>So, I think the term \"lifestyle business\" should be banned or rejected by this community.  Its a derogatory term used to apply to people who are chosing to go a different path, with the implicit assumption that that path is lame (eg: low growth, low chance of getting rich.) <p>There are certainly a lot of choices that founders have to make with regards to whether they are building a real business or not (EG: something sustainable that will make them rich even if a $10B+ company doesn't buy them in 24 months... rather than something that's a feature built to flip to someone with a real product offering.) ... and funding, location, team size, team composition (eg: when to hire marketing or sales people), etc are all independant of whether you're building a business.<p>You could bootstrap a company built to flip, or you could use VC money to do it.  You can use VC money to build a real business, or you can bootstrap a real business.<p>But I believe, strongly, that building a real business is the only way to go-- its the most likely path to getting flipped, and its the way you will end up with something more than an adrenaline hangover after 24 months. <p>I hope this is making sense... <p>In summary, focusing on the business is the path to success... and recognizing all of these choices (including who to take money from) have advantages and disadvantages for the business case.  For instance, one option might make great short term financial sense but be damaging in the long term-- if its a build to flip situation then you don't care about the long term.  But in making that choice, you're risking the flip taking longer than expected....<p>So, build a business.<p>PS-- Justification for this long post: I was recently talking to a startup, and they are totally focused on being acquired within the next 18 months.  Thats their plan.  Their only plan.  Every decision they make is with that assumption, and they are going to be in a world of pain 24 months from now if they aren't acquired in that time period.

Can you imagine that your project might be up against a modern-day Einstein?<p>4. I'm out of touch. Geniuses are still there, in plain sight.",

Don't just say, their service sucks I'm going to copy it, but say, the service sucks, I'm going to replace it altogether.  Amazon can't touch him with copyright suits.  This is basically extortion at this point.   Why?<p>There is NO WAY he could have thought that Amazon (or any other corporation) would not be ticked off at him at some point on the first day he started doing this.  In other words, he's moved onto \"legal\" extortion--trying to make the company he's copying to pay him more than $100,000 or else he will make them look like they are the evil ones.  Had he sold his company and started his own stats company, fine.  But since he doesn't know when to stop, this is getting ridiculous.<p>Finally, the fact that this is Amazon should not matter.  Everybody who develops IP (basically, everybody reading this) wants to be able to protect it.  I don't care if it's Amazon or Microsoft or Google.  Amazon didn't do anything wrong, and I don't agree that it should be spun that way.  As far as their 1-click patent goes, there was nothing like it on the web OR real life until Amazon invented it.  Finally, if people are going to bring up that Amazon had a famous patent, why can't Amazon bring up that the user allegedly extorting them, has served time for extorting users of another major internet company?",

Successive elements of the list differ in precisely one bit position: this is obvious inductively, since if G_n does, so do 0G_n and 1G_n^R, and since the last element of G_n is the first element of G_n^R, the last element of 0G_n differs from the first element of 1G_n^R in the first digit.

There were hundreds.<p>I was impressed to learn that Paul personally speaks to each group that makes it to the interview, but is not accepted into the program.  He does just what you're asking: explains why the group wasn't chosen and what they can do to improve the odds in the future or with other investors.<p>And, as another response to your post mentioned, there is no benefit to YC to enabling groups to game the application process.  Everything, everything, everything you need to know about the process has been documented by Paul and many of the groups who've been through it (both accepted and declined).<p>But I'll sum up:<p>Build something people want.  You need to prove you're building something people want.  A \"proxy for demand\" is necessary if you're inventing something new, or evidence that users want what you're building rather than your competition if it already exists.<p>Be capable of building what you say you want to build.  Link to a website or product that's in progress, or at least a website or product that you've built in the past.  I get the impression from my brief exposure to the process that one of the more frustrating things for YC is seeing a smart group with a good idea, but without the obvious ability to execute.  This is why they've discontinued requiring an \"idea\" on the application.  Just prove that you and your team can build great things.  If you don't have that evidence...why would they choose you when there are dozens of groups that do have evidence of building great things.  This isn't school where each project stands alone.  Show them your track record.  There's space for it on the application.<p>That's pretty much it for the early process.  Then you've gotta pull off a demo for the interview day, and show extreme passion for building a business.  Very few no-demo groups make it into the program, and I believe the percentage is shrinking (and I suspect the ones that do get in without a demo have a long and fancy track record--I bet Zenter would have been in no matter what because they have a kick ass track record of building things people want, but they also had a killer demo that they'd built in the weeks prior to the interview).  It can be partly mocked up, or carefully orchestrated to avoid the bugs, but they'll see through wholly fictional demos so don't try to fool them--these aren't your typical non-technical investors.",

See show #2 on NerdTV: <a href=\"http://www.pbs.org/cringely/nerdtv/shows/\">http://www.pbs.org/cringely/nerdtv/shows/</a><p>He said when he's not doing a start-up he lays on the couch morose, whereas he's happy and enjoying life when he IS doing a start-up.<p>I infer that the secret of success is to link pleasure to working on your start-up and pain to NOT doing it.  If your start-up feels like a grind then it's doomed.  Fortunately, you can re-program your emotional responses via various techniques.<p>You pretty much want to do that regardless so that if you do strike it rich, you don't feel useless and indolent for the rest of your life afterward.  The continued success stories are the people who were REALLY into what they did.  For example, Bill Gates could have retired long ago; Michael Jordan didn't win one championship and decide that was all he wanted; Steve Jobs kept on going while Steve Wozniak checked out, relaxed, and got fat.  (I love Woz, I just think if you're possibly the world's best at what you do, abruptly stopping can't be very fulfilling, even though I understand he did many other worthwhile things like teaching kids.)<p>",

Opera Mobile and Nokia's S60 browser are the clear market leaders (and, yes, both of them render full web pages with JavaScript/AJAX as a thumbnail that you can then zoom in on) See: <a href=\"http://www.opera.com/products/mobile/\">http://www.opera.com/products/mobile/</a> and <a href=\"http://www.s60.com/browser/\">http://www.s60.com/browser/</a> (btw, the S60 browser is open-source and based on webkit). The iPhone browser is <i>supposed</i> to be very good, but no one's really seen it yet. And it took many years of work for Nokia and Opera to get where they are today (Microsoft still isn't there, and they've really been trying).<p>2. Touchscreens. If all you want is a touchscreen, you can pick up, say, the LG Prada phone or the Samsung Ultra Smart F700. They both sport full-screen touchscreens like the iPhone. There are others.<p>3. Mobile fonts: please. Virtually all modern smartphones have nice, antialiased fonts. Take any cheap Windows Mobile phone for example.<p>4. Big Screens: You <i>can</i> get phones with bigger screens than the iPhone. (But until they invent fold-away screens, they're gonna be bulky)<p>5. Mobile interfaces suck. Ok, I'll give you this one.

Almost every demand curve is downward sloping, yes, but that doesn't mean every demand curve is the same.<p>If Joel's graph is accurate, and the Y axis starts at 0, this demand curve is VERY interesting.  It's one of the most elastic curves I've seen.  A 15% drop in price from 65 pounds to 55 leads to a 500% increase in volume.  Of course the data isn't perfect, this is assuming consumers will purchase at the same rates as businesses.  <p>If Joel wants to maximize profit, where profit = (Price-Marginal Cost) x Volume - Fixed costs, then the ideal price should be around 55 pounds.<p>This makes sense.  For software development firms, cheaper is usually better.  If you can reduce your price by X%, and increase your volume by more than X%, then go for it. You want to do this because software firms almost always have very low marginal costs (bandwidth), and very high fixed costs (development).<p><p>",

It might help by making it easier for corporations to adopt open source software on a system-wide scale.

This time would be better spent developing future versions, addressing current bug issues, or any number of other possibilities.  Also, the conflict that could arise would not bode well either.<p>So while I find it to be an interesting initiative, I really hope that the positives and negatives at least offset each other, and hopefully the positive aspects will make the entire project better for the open source community.",

IMHO, it doesn't work quite as well as it sounds like it should.<p>Problem is, information is lost every time someone communicates their needs.  Customers don't actually need what they <i>say</i> they need; there's always some detail that they forgot to mention that only shows up when you watch them use the product.  That usually changes the tools that the programmers need, which often aren't the tools the programmers say they need, because programmers have their own preconceptions about how the solution should be implemented.  Someone who's only done JavaEE programming will likely say \"I need a tool that automates maintanance of my Hibernate and Spring configuration files\", when they really mean \"I need to store my user's session data between sessions.\"<p>There's often a strong organizational pressure to use the output of the toolmakers, even if the tools aren't suitable for the job.  In my case, I'm not sure that I'd use our platform if just given our customer's requirements and my choice of toolset.  But I can't really say that, because it harms morale and makes me seem like a lone wolf who can't work with other people.  (Okay, I <i>have</i> said that, with the expected result.)<p>The nice thing about research labs is that nobody expects them to be useful.  Other programmers can pick up or drop their work based on whether it actually <i>is</i> useful, not by some corporate policy.  Unfortunately, the people most likely to pick up an interesting research lab project generally refuse to work for a big company.  So there's a long history of guys in garages ripping off the best ideas of corporate research departments, and eating the parent company in the process.<p>If I were managing a large, cash-rich corporation, I'd have a small exclave a mile or so away from the main campus.  It would have two buildings: a top-notch research lab, and an incubator (and a shared cafeteria, of course).  The research lab would be staffed with high-priced Ph.Ds and tenured professors, the best in their fields.  The incubator would be full of high school dropouts on grad student salaries, but with $40M+ stock grants contingent upon building something that millions of people will use.  All executives from the parent company would be prohibited from setting foot on this campus.<p>Come to think of it, this sounds a lot like grad school, but without the bullshit.",

Flex has richer components because it settles on only one technology (Flash) and therefore it leverages Flash to its full capabilities.<p>Another advantage of Flex over OpenLaszlo is the Flex IDE (aka Flex Builder). It's a great product! (Note: Flex Builder is closed-source, and a bit expensive -- $500 I believe)<p>Despite the fact that Flex is Flash-only, I think they did a great job integrating it to the web stack. For example, Flex uses CSS to define the component styles. ActionScript also feels pretty much like Javascript. As a matter of fact, when I started using Flex I had no Flash experience whatsoever and was up-and-running very quickly.<p>",

For sharing homemade texts, there already lots of other established mechanisms (ie blogs). <p>What they have in common is the neat user experience (YouTube videos are the only ones that almost always work).

This new frame is more compatible with your startup frame, since it understands that stupidity of large organizations creates opportunities for startups to succeed.",

Difficult, and very stressful, but possible.<p>When I was first asked to co-found my startup, I immediately became very unhappy at work.  It was just too much cognitive dissonance.  Once I had a startup (which had been my life's goal all along), why waste 8 hours a day working for somebody else, where I'm so much less productive?<p>Over time, I adjusted.  I just saw work as having one set of rules and expectations, and startup as having another set of rules and expectations.  So I gave up trying to introduce more productive technologies at work, because it wasn't going to happen anyway.  And I adjusted my expectations for productivity downwards, because hey, my boss doesn't know that you can do better than JavaEE levels anyway.<p>End result: I'm much happier at work, which is <i>perceived</i> as being more productive because most people judge based on attitude instead of results.  And then I go home and do everything my boss tells me not to on my startup.  Only downside is that my startup may launch before my project at work does, which renders moot one of my main reasons for keeping the day job.<p>It's similar to switching keyboard layouts.  When you first learn Dvorak, you <i>will</i> forget how to touch-type on Qwerty.  But if you keep typing on Qwerty, eventually they'll start separating in your mind.  For a long time, I would automatically type Qwerty whenever I saw a Gnome desktop and Dvorak when I saw Windows.  Then it further refined itself into typing Qwerty whenever I saw Netbeans and Dvorak whenever I saw AIM.  Now I'm basically fluent in both layouts, and can consciously switch between the two of them.<p>Also, I suspect every startup founder will have to undergo another frame shift eventually: shifting from the general startup culture to <i>YOUR</i> startup culture.  Right now, most of us are internalizing the values of Startupping, News.YC, Ruby on Rails or Python, and various entrepreneurial blogs.  Eventually that'll have to shift to the cultural values of the particular startup that you found.  Any past or present YCombinator founders around to comment on this? ",

Two tips: make it shorter(three lines?); dont use random font color/formatting style.<p>---------<p>Hi Zaid,\n \nKoonji is an innovative experiment to redefine the way people access and use information.  The main objective is to make web research more meaningful by providing a complete solution to search, enhance, organize and share relevant online information. Koonji is a community-powered step-by-step how-to guide to do effective searches on the web. \nPeople often turn to the internet to find information and to seek advice typically starting with a search engine. But there is no way they can get organized information and a guide to trace the path for them. Koonji solves this problem by organizing information by breaking down topics into multiple steps and providing the best resources available along with helpful tips. The step-by-step guides can be on any topic from baking a cake to applying for a home loan. <p>Koonji's content is all community driven, the guides or \"Koonji's\" are authored by users usually drawing from their experiences. Koonji believes that the community's collective experiences are the best place to generate information. Users find organizes information and are also aided by a companion Koonji toolbar travels with the users, allows users to tag and save information as a Koonji. <p>Whether one is looking to learn how to buy a HDTV, how to organize a birthday party, how to find a job or how to plan a vacation\u00c3\u0083\u00c2\u0082\u00c3\u0082\u00c2\u0097the process for completing these activities can be time consuming and frustrating. Koonji users benefit from the discoveries know-how of others, avoid time consuming web searches and any the trial and error method of finding information.  Koonji.com is information by users and for users seeking information.<p>Please do contact me should you have any queries at steve@koonji.com .<p>Warm Regards,<p>Team Koonji   <p>-----------",

                "text": "First of this is not about Hacking or web2.0. This is about why I decided to have a startup. You don't have to read.But if you do, thanks for your time.<p>For a long time I thought I wanted to have my own business. I starter with  Import-export. That did not last a year and left me with more debt than what I make in 9 months. I am still paying for that matter fact. Then I thought I had a gift for seeing what will be a hot in technology. I remember talking to friends about web based word processors, mobile voip and niche social networks before this things were what they are today. But soon after I realized that most people thought of it too, but like me they did not do anything about it. I found myself running left and right, getting with developers and working on cool projects, only to abandon them and getting into something bigger. I am a Dreamer. I dream of products in the day and gather people to implement them by the evening. And that is it. After it is done I keep fwding the launch. I realized that I was not a business man. <p>So why starting a startup?\nWell I think  I want to be a Teacher, or a role model. I would like to build a successful startup, but I would love to sit on the other side of the table and listen someone who has nothing more than an idea and $1.75 to pay the bus fair to come talk about their idea. I think I would love to sit down in the coffee shop and get so excited about his/her idea that I can yell  \"You are a FUCKING Genius KId\". I think I would love to tell her/her to call someone who had something similar  and get with him/her to build their startup.I think I would love to be woken up by the same entrepreneurs at 3 AM, just because the servers are down and they are freaking out as users in Russia are assaulting them with emails. I think I would love to help him/her calm down and find a solution to the problem. I think I would love to relax sometime in my beach-side coffee shop and laugh with them about how 3 years ago they had only an idea, a passion and $1.75, and today the only think that worries them is \"how the HELL are they going to keep 1, 2, 3 millions users happy?\"<p>But before doing all that, I think I need to be in the same situation the kid is. I must start with nothing and build something. I must really be tired and know that the only thing that is keeping me up is Passion. I must be nervous at launch and wait for the first 1000 registered users. I would be a fool if i was to give advices to someone if I don't know how they feel at the time. The problem may be different, but the feeling is the same. <p>Maybe you feel like me. Maybe you like to THINK and CREATE, but adore to SHARE. Maybe instead of sharing features like WEB2.0 standard, you want to share your experience and help someone else become successful. Maybe you just want to smile and tell the entrepreneur. \"You got yourself, myself and my wife's  money into a HELL of A MESS, Now ROLL UP your sleeves and let's FIX THIS THING\"<p>That's why I am starting a STARTUP.",

If you just keep hacking at it and ruthlessly revise the code you've already written, you'll get there eventually.<p>IMHO, the best benefit of learning a lot is knowing how to <i>not</i> write code.  A journeyman programmer can crank out lots of code in a short period of time and quickly implement new features.  A master programmer can recognize that by restating the problem a little, you don't have to write <i>any</i> code and a simple, elegant solution falls out of tools and algorithms that are already available.<p>Of course, the best way to become a better programmer is to hack on your startup a lot.  That's why you're best off starting even if you don't think you're ready yet.",

Fortran is too much like C, and think about how good C is for writing differential equations. There are tons of potential bugs in the programs I see, and very few opportunities to check for correctness. Development time takes an order of magnitude longer than it should. I've argued with physicists many times over this, and the issues they bring up are always:<p>- Alternatives are too slow<p>- I have a huge code base that I don't want to port over.<p>- I don't need (eg.) closures. If I ever designed a program that needed them, I wouldn't choose Fortran, but that has never happened<p>- (most popular) Programming is just a tool. I'm interested in the physic, not programming, and Fortran is Good Enough<p>I don't know if Fortress will succeed. I hope it does, but unless they can show that Fortress programs are both shorter <i>and</i> faster, I don't think it will happen. Mathematica,  Matlab and IDL already have too much of a lock on the market for 'inefficient' computing.<p>My money is on a Mathematica clone eventually becoming faster than Fortran.

What purpose does Xobin they serve?<p>In the entire length of their website, they do not explain what they do. They certainly don't in a single sentence. Perhaps, the magnitude and source of their investment suggests they are on to something. But, what explanation they have reeks of charlatanism in platitudinous corporate doublespeak: \"in-depth analysis\" that \"takes email productivity to a new level.\" Please. This of course raises the questions what do they analyze? And how do they improve productivity?

Our site looks downright old-fashioned, too (I've spent the last month or so working on our new site, and though I think we'll be launching it this week it'll still probably take a few more weeks or work before I'll really be happy with it).  Web design is strikingly hard for nerds who don't spend a lot of time doing it.<p>Suggestions:<p>Smaller link titles.  I can't believe I'm saying this, because most sites have way too small fonts for everything and it's infuriating for those of us with squinty nerd eyes that have been staring at CRT screens since they were TVs.<p>It's hard to do the \"multiple columns of wildly contrasting content\" thing well.  Most sites look jumbled up, and yours is no exception.  Smaller thumbnails of the media links, particularly in the top section, would be a start.  Probably dividing it 67/33 rather than 50/50.  There's a reason newspapers do it, and a reason Yahoo's CSS bundles don't offer a 50/50 column layout at all--it's hard to figure out what's going on, as there's not immediate focus.  It just feels confused.<p>I agree with the other poster who suggested same-size thumbs.  Pick a couple of sizes and styles for everything (everything means: pics, fonts, headers, etc.) and stick to it.  You're doing fine on minimizing extraneous color (which could be important with all of the crazy crap going on in the pictures).",

The number of readers is also a missing information. <p>If v is the vote value and n is the number of voters, v/n is the score. It is a value between -100% and 100%. 1/n is the vote weight on the score. A big vote weight could motivate people to read and vote. Karma would also influence vote weight. <p>The number of readers is also a usefull feedback, a kind of popularity, and it should also somehow influence karma.<p>Adding the possibility to view news sorted by score, popularity and/or weight would give new perspective on the information.<p>Last year I wanted to create an electronic journal using this mechanism with other features I'll keep secret for now.

First of all, it only provides a substitute functionality; if news.yc gets PM then this is totally unnecessary. For more features, there are more ambitious projects like medium (I'm not sure if they're in the same category).<p>Second, being an unofficial product degrades credibility by a lot; there's no reason why a user would expect to find messages for them on an external server. I imagine this as a disposable tool, like mailinator, in case some people want to trade emails or other non-public data without having to write here or disclose anything personal. Post and delete. For this specific purpose I do think its useful, but how much further beyond the audience especially concerned about privacy, I don't know.<p>Third, loading an external page in a frame can confuse and annoy users, so I think it's not a good practice. news.yc users might tolerate this kind of hack because they know what's behind it, but I can't say for sure.<p>Of course, if you have other thoughts/suggestions, do let me know, publicly or privately :)",

Character and charm - You don't want to be sitting at a cookie-cutter cold Starbucks or a place that doesn't have a local feel to it. The best places are those that have cool furniture, colorful walls and decor, and fun staff.<p>2. Good music - If you're going to be sitting at a place for hours and hours, the last thing you want to have to endure is crappy music or music that's too loud and distracting.<p>3. Mixed crowd - It's nice to have a diversity of people wherever you work because when you start daydreaming (not that I ever do), you can people watch. San Francisco is such a diverse city that it's always fun to see all the eclectic types that make this city so wonderful to live in.<p>4.

Standards are a means to that end.  Vendor lock-in, on the other hand, stifles competition, and produces lower quality at a higher price.<p>Consider how unfortunate it would be if, for instance, the WWW were built not on W3C standards, but on proprietary technology; say IIS, IE, and an undocumented network protocol.  In that case, innovation would slow remarkably.  Competitive browers (Firefox, Safari) could not be developed because they couldn't talk to the IIS servers (the protocol is secret, remember) and competitive servers (Apache) could not be developed for the same reason.  The only way competitive products could emerge would be for some firm to develop a client/server/protocol stack, and market the hell out of it until it achieved sufficient penetration to be successful.<p>It's a lot cheaper to compete when the protocol is open, competition is what produces great product, and that's why I think it best that solutions built around open standards not just thump, but crush any proprietary alternatives.  Multimedia is a bit of a disaster in this regard, but I see no reason RIA need go the same way.<p>I can't get on board with the notion that standards are only good for lowest-common-denominator sorts of things.  The internet seems to work ok, for instance.  As for people going 'above and beyond', to the degree that such activity represents the 'extend' part of E/E/E, standards can't prevent it, but responsible people ought to shun it.<p>As for MSFT's ability to cram product: they can bundle with an OS that has 90%+ of the market.  I don't think their ability to guarantee their products penetration (not necessarily use, not necessarily sales, but availability) is a matter for serious dispute.  If they want Silverlight to be a viable platform, they just have to roll it into IE 7.X or IE 8.0.\n",

Standards are a nice way of encoding minimal required commonalities for a class of something, but should never be used to prevent anyone from going above and beyond.<p>    I also suspect MSFT's ability to cram anything down the throat of subjects opposed is highly overrated. I personally bought my first windows machine a few months ago, having been (still am) a mac, sometime linux, user for years. If Silverlight (or flex/flash) gains huge penetration, it is likely because people prefer having it to not, not because of any 'cramming' by MS/Adobe.<p>",

I don't have any grounds in this field, it's just about personal experience in dealing with smart/dumb people. and it's not related only to being smart or not, it's related to everything, even sports. I've met people who've set their mind to be great at something and they succeeded. <p>I'm not talking about those exceptions who read or write when others can barely speak, I'm referring to the majority here. \nI don't agree with one of your points: intelligence is not changeable by effort, it's actually changeable by mindset and self confidence.<p>For example the number one guy in my university was also the guy working the most. but he was not brilliant, he was only really determined to be the best. \nthanks for your comments ;)",

I've found this information for a few carriers, but it's not complete by any means. For instance, it looks like Cingular (U.S.) and Rogers (Canada) use the same method as T-Mobile (U.S.), just using a different number (500 for T-Mobile, 121 for Cingular, and 0000000000 for Rogers).<p>I may have to devote a few days to digging out this information by hand from the carrier web sites.

                "text": "My first company (Big Bear) found a way of programming\nVCRs and DVDRs from a computer through USB, Ethernet\nor Wireless. It's possible to manage and program\nany number of video receivers in a house. It's sort\nof like Tivo with no subscription and it works with any brand. <p>My second company (Brontosaurus Software) is solving is\nstreamlining software engineering with the algorithm engine so that programmers can write code by describing what\nthe algorithm does and not how it works. So let's say on a good day you can write say 50 algorithms, what if you could write 1,000 instead and then the code that's generated is readable. <p>So the first problem is being able to write code based on human thinking as opposed to machine thinking. The second problem is generating readable code. The third problem is that the code that's generated is composed of reusable code.\nThe fourth problem is creating structure for software so that managing the complexity is easier.<p>I eventually decided that only Lisp could so what I want to make it work.<p>The point is that the algorithm engine will make it possible for programmers to write code once and not spend time optimizing their code and fixing bugs. Fixing bugs and looking for them consumes too much time. <p>I was reading about the software bugs that cost billions\nand years of snags in the F-22 jet so I decided that I'd \"discover\" a way to solve the problem of writing code faster, making code more manageable, and making (most of all) source code readable and reusable.

It's no longer available, but I'm pretty sure the widestreen T60 has the same hardware in a much thinner, lighter package for the same price. The Macbook-sized Z61t is also a good bet. Ubuntu almost works out of the box, though I had to install a video driver before I could start X on the live CD. Debian works with no more hassle than usual.<p>I've never heard Thinkpads called pretty, but they do look like the serious machines they are. Dells are mostly cheap crap, and they look the part. I wouldn't worry too much about looks - instead, consider that Thinkpads, like many Apples have magnesium frames and hard drive shock protection.",

I, obviously, don't believe this is representative--a large number of programming tasks aren't reduce-able beyond a certain level.  But for a 50% LoC reduction, I might consider it.<p>There's a lot of other considerations, and right now Haskell and Erlang are leading my \"what'll my next back end projects use\" list (after Perl 6...which I'm getting excited about after seeing Audrey Tang's talk about it from a few days ago, as it appears it will fix every single major problem with Perl, by my reckoning)...but I'm not going to rule out a language merely because my first glance at it makes me uncomfortable or confused (if that were the case, I would have never used Perl, Python, Ruby, and I would be avoiding messing with Erlang and Haskell...I might have even continued trying to figure out Java, since it seemed comfortably familiar based on my C experience, but I believe that would have been a very bad instinct).",

It seems to be rarely used in the latter context, though I can see several advantages off the top of my head:<p>- You can write your web app as if it only runs on one machine, so you don't have to worry about distributed session storage.  For some continuation-based web frameworks, serializing continuations seems pretty messy.<p>- You can use your RDBMS's own cache buffer instead of memcached, since it can be transparently distributed by the OS.  So your app can simply talk to the database directly.<p>- From the propagandas, most SSI systems promise to automatically detect new nodes and add it to its pool of resources.  So this saves you some time deploying your software as you scale up.<p>I was wondering if anyone here has any theoretical knowledge or experience in running SSI clusters, and how it compares to the classic load-balancer/web-servers/memcached/database-server configuration in serving multiuser web apps.<p>Thanks!",

Some people are clearly keen to move up the leader board and starting a new thread is one way to do that.  How about not rewarding karma for a thread's score?

                "text": "<i>Do It</i><p>Author: Andy Hertzfeld, June 1982 <p>Many of the academic types who were involved in creating the earliest implementations of the graphical user interface at Xerox PARC and various universities sort of sneered at the first generation of personal computers when they appeared in the mid-seventies, since the early personal computers were much less powerful than the machines that they were used to programming. There wasn't that much you could do with only four kilobytes of memory and no disk drive. <p>\nBut Larry Tesler, who was a key member of the Smalltalk team in the Learning Research Group at Xerox PARC, felt differently. He was really excited by the potential of personal computers, buying a Commodore PET as soon as one became available in 1977. He was one of the demonstrators at Apple's famous Xerox PARC visit in December 1979, and he was so impressed by the Apple visitors that he quit PARC and started working at Apple on July 17, 1980, as the manager of the Lisa Applications team. <p>\nLarry championed consistency between applications, and made many contributions to what eventually became the Macintosh User Interface. He was also the leading advocate and implementor at Apple of user testing: actually trying out our software out on real users and seeing what happened. Starting in the summer of 1981, Larry organized a series of user tests of the nascent Lisa software, recruiting friends and family to try out the software for the first time, while being observed by the Apple designers who recorded their reactions. <p>\nThe user tests were conducted in a specially constructed room featuring a one-way mirror, so observers could watch the tests without being intrusive. The tests were conducted by a moderator who made sure the user felt comfortable and showed her the basics of using a mouse. Then, with no further instruction, users were asked to perform specific tasks, without help from the moderator, like editing some text and saving it. The moderator encouraged each user to mumble under her breath while doing the tasks, revealing her current thinking as much as possible. Each session was audio or videotaped for later analysis. <p>\nWhen the software required confirmation from the user, it displayed a small window called a \"dialog box\", that contained a question, and presented two buttons, for positive or negative confirmation. The buttons were labeled \"Do It\" and \"Cancel\". The designers observed that a few users seemed to stumble at the point that the dialog was displayed, clicking \"Cancel\" when they should have clicked \"Do It\", but it wasn't clear what they were having trouble with. <p>\nFinally, the team noticed one user that was particularly flummoxed by the dialog box, who even seemed to be getting a bit angry. The moderator interrupted the test and asked him what the problem was. He replied, \"I'm not a dolt, why is the software calling me a dolt?\" <p>\nIt turns out he wasn't noticing the space between the 'o' and the 'I' in 'Do It'; in the sans-serif system font we were using, a capital 'I' looked very much like a lower case 'l', so he was reading 'Do It' as 'Dolt' and was therefore kind of offended. <p>\nAfter a bit of consideration, we switched the positive confirmation button label to 'OK' (which was initially avoided, because we thought it was too colloquial), and from that point on people seemed to have fewer problems.",
