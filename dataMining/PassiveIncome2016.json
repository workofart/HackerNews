Let's just say a manager is super secretive. Do you know how many people in the chain know performance anyway... Current and former employees. Current and former recruiters of these employees.

And you're saying all these people also don't have that human urge to brag about these rock stars of the investment world?

But no, there's a not a bunch of professional investors with serious weight under management and outside clients beating the market over a secular horizon.<p>There's a handful, and if you are at one of them congrats to you. But to come on a forum saying there's a bunch of professional investors beating the market, they just all happen to super secretive billionaires and they don't tell anyone about it. That's misleading. That's tech back office got your info from a e-book kinda talk. And it would be at odds with your original thesis that folks that beat the market are secretive and don't talk.

They might give you an indication though.<p>[1]: <a href=\"http://allfinancialmatters.com/2012/08/29/sp-rolling-total-returns-1-5-10-20-25-and-30-years/\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://allfinancialmatters.com/2012/08/29/sp-rolling-total-r...</a><p>Edit: Here's [2] a better (?) graph of the S&P 500 with the 30 year rolling returns, inflation adjusted and dividends reinvested.

Also because I thought I would learn something new (setting up WP blog) and this seemed very &quot;shippable&quot;. I completed the application process over the course of a year and haven&#x27;t written a blog post in over a year.<p>Thanks to a complete lack of material in this niche, the site (<a href=\"http:&#x2F;&#x2F;pengapplicant.ca\" rel=\"nofollow\">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;pengapplicant.ca</a>) gets a decent amount of organic search traffic given the niche size (2k page views per month) and I make about $15&#x2F;month in Adsense. Recently I was also contacted by someone who sells materials for the application and exam and have become an affiliate for them. It&#x27;s only been one month, but i&#x27;ve already made one referral which netted me $100. So passive income on this after hosting costs is probably $220-ish and will be more in 2017 hopefully with more affiliate sales. Obviously very small potatoes, but I never set out to make any money for this and it looks like now it will at least cover my yearly professional dues ;)<p>To be honest, the best part is the messages I get from people saying how I helped them get their license.

It grows as it discovers new groups and events via a few channels.<p>As it finds and imports groups and then events, it categorizes each based on how they&#x27;re described. If it&#x27;s from Meetup.com, the category data and topic are reasonably good so it starts with that. If the source is Eventbrite, less so. If the source is an event website, even harder.<p>After ~15 months, it&#x27;s discovered about 105k keywords&#x2F;phrases, some only barely related. Of those, only about 7500 are actually useful. Not surprisingly, they include languages, frameworks, companies, products and combinations of words. (Side note: I&#x27;ve found words like &quot;hacking&quot; are less of an indicator now than when I started.. because everyone  is &quot;hacking&quot; something.. marketing, cooking, etc.)<p>From all that, groups are qualified in&#x2F;out based on their overall score. I manually review things that are borderline but that&#x27;s 2-3 most weeks.

I&#x27;ve rebuilt it from the ground up to wire in the ML processing to scale across all the cities.<p>I later did some major refactoring to have pluggable output so it can broadcast into a Slack channel (done &amp; released) and eventually send you a reminder DM or text (via Twilio!)",

Nothing is truly passive of course, but it makes me think about what I do<p>- SourceGuardian. This is encryption software I set up in 2002 as I had a need myself and the nearest product was $6000 at the time. It has generated a great passive income since then. Enough to pay all my bills. 2016 was no different. I work with 2 other people on it, one of whom I&#x27;ve never met (he&#x27;s in Russia) and it works well<p>- Competitor Monitor. This <i>used</i> to be a side-project 5 years ago, but it has grown significantly and in the past year we are up by 35% and we have grown our team. Strangely this has now become passive in the sense that I have created a structure and systemised the business (read The Emyth Revisited book) and that has allowed me to step out. I am not more of an investor than a day-to-day contributor<p>- UKscrap.com.  This one died in 2016. The site is still there, but competition and my lack of interest killed it<p>As I said, nothing is truly passive, but you need to have a passion for whatever you do and I would try to create a &#x27;passive index&#x27; for your ideas. How much time will they take to get off the ground, how much to run monthly, what is the product life cycle (if you can work that out!).

Everywhere in the admin panel it showed 0. 0 downloads, not a single dime earned, even after a few days. We were devastated.<p>But than I found another tab in the utterly shitty admin panel and it hit me like a rock. The numbers on the dashboard were a monthly overview and in fact we earned already hundreds of dollars and downloads in just a few days. I went back to the computer, but together an even better watch face, set it to 1$ again and watched it selling like hotcakes.<p>However it tried out quite quickly after that. People started to copy stuff and giving it away for free and I never bought the watch myself, I just used the emulator to test my apps.

QQQ is on that list and it&#x27;s a NASDAQ index ETF. If you primarily own indexes though then you don&#x27;t really own shares in the individual companies comprising that index, so I don&#x27;t think you have something to loan technically. Like you might sort of own a lot of Apple through an S&amp;P index, but you can&#x27;t really deliver shares of Apple to a short seller.<p>Two columns to note in the link above:<p>* if you look at the &quot;% Float&quot; column in the link above, you can see that TSLA is at 32.0%, meaning that 32% of all TSLA stock is held by people that are shorting it. this calculation is a little more nuanced than this because shorts are only borrowing it and the stock kind of has two owners, but it paints the general picture: 1&#x2F;3 of Tesla stock holders are there because they hope Tesla stock decreases in value. I think they&#x27;re dead wrong but that&#x27;s how markets are made.<p>* the &quot;days to cover&quot; column means that if all the short sellers tried to close their position (ie, buy stock in the company), how many days would it take that to happen at an average day&#x27;s volume? this can be an indicator of companies ripe for a short squeeze, where a company announces unexpected good news and shorts rapidly try to close their position but not enough people want to sell and so the stock price skyrockets.

GOGO of Gogo inflight Wifi is listed at 43% float and 21 days to cover, but its borrow rates are around 8%. I don&#x27;t know why.<p>* in many cases, there is a short argument worth listening to and there&#x27;s a reason many people are shorting a stock. GoPro&#x2F;GPRO is currently paying <i>86%</i> for people to lend out their shares to short sellers. You could buy GoPro and lend out your shares but then you run the risk of owning GoPro and it&#x27;s a big question mark how big that risk is. I face that same risk in owning Tesla, but I think the short argument is garbage and I really believe in the company and that&#x27;s enough for me.<p>* the tesla situation was kind of a perfect storm because it has a lot of fervent believers on both sides. companies that people are really passionate about might be hard to come by.",

The thought was that since there was a potential merger coming up, shareholders were going to need to vote on it one way or the other.

I can see how they CAN be useful, but the fact that they are mostly &quot;consumption only&quot;  and mostly curated by one person, means that there is a lot of room to improve them, which is exactly what we&#x27;re trying to do with our community platform.

If you stay with the fund for at least two years (and it&#x27;s of the correct kind), the tax rate is 15% over the gains, so you have an after-tax return of around 5% per year above inflation. And that&#x27;s for a fund which basically never gives negative returns.<p>You can go further and buy government bonds directly, through the Tesouro Direto system. Those indexed by the SELIC rate (which is sort of related to the CDI) are currently around 13.5% per year, before administration fees and taxes (in fact, the boring funds I mentioned above mostly invest in these SELIC-indexed government bonds).<p>This will change when (and if) rates get lower, but so far, investing in these funds or bonds is the simplest (and one of the best) way to have passive income.",

Corporate bonds, for instance, will have a higher return, due to their higher risk.<p>As for inflation, when it increases the SELIC&#x2F;CDI rates tend to rise with it too. And if you&#x27;re afraid of that (it hasn&#x27;t been long since we had a hyperinflation, so a lot of people still are), another government bond (NTN-B) has a return of inflation (measured by the IPCA index) plus a pre-fixed component (currently around 6%). Due to its pre-fixed component, it has some interest rate risk (if the interest rate rises, its present value drops, and vice-versa), but that&#x27;s not a problem if you intend to keep it to term.<p>And, actually, the high interest rate is set by the government, as a way to control the inflation, so it&#x27;s not as linked to the risk of default as one might think. The government could decide to lower the interest rate (and it has: a few years ago, it was set lower, but that led to the currently higher inflation, so the government increased it again to contain the inflation).",

It's not trivial to do, however, while investing in the boring funds I mentioned is extremely easy for anyone with a bank account, and investing in government bonds is as easy as investing in stock. In particular, for both the funds and government bonds the tax is paid automatically, while if you invest abroad, you have to do the calculations yourself, and from what I've read they are not as simple. Not to mention the extra cost and risk of opening an account outside your country; for instance, the Brazilian customer protection laws won't apply to an account outside the country, for obvious reasons. All in all, it's a lot more research to do, with the extra risk of investing outside your home jurisdiction, for a much smaller return, and the only benefit being reducing your exposition to your own government - one I'll be always exposed to, since I live here (it could easily impose taxes on capital held abroad, for instance).<p>> But surely that's the interest rate that their central bank charges to the banks (which influences the interest rates banks pay/charge for savings/loans with them), not the interest rate that they are paying on their own government bonds? I'm not an expert, but I'm pretty sure those are two very different things.<p>It's complicated, but basically the government sets the SELIC rate target, and buys/sells government bonds so the SELIC rate moves towards that target. The SELIC rate itself is the interest rate banks pay each other for a one-day loan with government bonds as the guarantee. Finally, one of the government bonds (the LFT) pays the principal ajusted by the SELIC rate at its term. There is also the pre-fixed government bonds (the LTN), which pays a fixed value but is bought for less, the inflation-indexed NTN-B, which I already mentioned, and a few others.<p>As for why increasing the interest rate helps control the inflation, that's one thing I still don't quite understand.

It means you don't have to manually tune JPEG quality for each image and can get some PNGs quantized to 256 colors if visual differences are negligible.<p>It uses a modified quality metric based on Contrast Sensitivity Function (CSF) and contrast masking of DCT coefficients for JPEGs, and a custom one for color-quantized PNGs (major difference is sensitivity to noticeable gradients).<p>Optimage has a lot of tweaks to compression algorithms to squeeze some more bytes (Pareto principle here). But much more bytes are saved by exhaustively trying all possible image data representations, e.g. fast brute forcing of PNG delta filters, dirty alpha, palette sorting.<p>There's a good PNG test corpus at <a href=\"http://css-ig.net/images/png-test-corpus/png-test-corpus-2017.zip\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://css-ig.net/images/png-test-corpus/png-test-corpus-201...</a>. Optimage \u2013 276 058 bytes, ImageOptim \u2013 297 561 bytes. But this is just a lossless test.<p>> Also are you going to support and fix the frequent bugs that png optimizers run into with esoteric color space/alpha combinations beyond the best effort...?<p>At some stage, yes. Right now I'm focused on things like losslessly rotating JPEGs according to Orientation meta in Exif, adding CMYK to RGB convertion when Convert to sRGB is ON, supporting container formats like ICO and ICNS, more tweaks to compressors for performance and smaller output, GUI improvements, etc.', 'by': 'vladdanilov', 'parent': 13150372, 'type': 'comment', 'id': 13150423, 'time': 1481451234}"

Rent-seeking results in reduced economic efficiency through poor allocation of resources, reduced actual wealth creation, lost government revenue, increased income inequality, and (potentially) national decline.</i> - Wikipedia<p>From <i>Taking Back Adam Smith and \u201cClassic Liberalism\u201d</i>:<p><i>Many conservative economists claim to be staunch followers of Adam Smith.  They shout slogans such as \u201cSupply and Demand!\u201d  \u201cCapitalism\u201d! \u201c  \u201cLet the markets work!\u201d  However, for anyone who actually read Adam Smith, you would note that the \u201cinvisible hand\u201d was not his only observation of the inner workings of capitalism.  Adam Smith recognized that many in the economy were making gobs of money, but weren\u2019t contributing anything.  He was referring to what was eventually called \u201ceconomic rent\u201d.<p>Smith observed that all production required 3 things.  Land, Capital, and Labor.  A very simple example would be a brick factory.  The building and oven needed to create the bricks are the \u201ccapital\u201d \u2013 the owners are the capitalists.  The people making the bricks is the \u201clabor\u201d \u2013 the people doing the actual work.  The Land the factory occupies and the clay used to make the bricks is the \u201cland\u201d \u2013 the owners of the land are the \u201cRentiers\u201d.  Any money made by selling the bricks is then divided up between these three groups: the rentiers, the capitalists, and the workers.</i><p>Where many here on HN and I will differ is what forms of passive income are rent seeking rather value creating applications of the output of one's previous labor.<p>Note that you can even be pro-Capitalism and anti-rent-seeking: <i>How Economists Duped Us into Attacking Capitalism Instead of Parasitic Rent-Seeking</i> <a href=\"http://evonomics.com/economists-duped-attacking-capitalism/\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://evonomics.com/economists-duped-attacking-capitalism/</a>', 'by': 'eevilspock', 'parent': 13152309, 'type': 'comment', 'id': 13153052, 'time': 1481488638}"
