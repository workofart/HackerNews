The guy who wrote it isn&#x27;t interested in making improvements, (and it can certainly use improvements) and is happy living off the income from people&#x27;s per event usage rights.  I am sure if something modern and regularly updated came out, it would get a lot of uptake. Thing is, the portion of it that runs during the event needs to be able to run offline since venues don&#x27;t always have reliable internet, and that also means you would be going to at least the first few events for support.. And your tests better be good, since time is of the essence if some does go wrong mid event. I thought about it, and decided I was not interested in dealing with all that when my job pays pretty well. Still, it&#x27;s a real opportunity.",

In the case of a lot of legal solutions, good enough is often a murky risk&#x2F;reward calculation based on legal concepts the client may not understand completely.<p>I still think there&#x27;s enormous room for improvement, both in helping clients understand the concepts and the risks they&#x27;re taking, and also in providing better automated solutions.",

So we had weather station networks, NOAA forecast runs and NASA satellite data in a workable schema in our shop way faster than average.  Mix of C, PowerShell, Perl, and the nonstandard parts of T-SQL, highly parallelized, tricky but fast.<p>After the &quot;workable schema&quot; was established, the rules came back and we acted more responsibly. Smart instead of clever.<p>Ran this stuff all day long, getting every piece of data asap. Things that can only be calculated with a full day of data we poked and prodded the meteorologists to express in &quot;partial aggregates&quot;, which to me were just like the map steps before an EOD reduce.<p>Took a lot of mutual understanding and iterating but worth it in the end. When the ultimate data source (satellite or radar site for us) posted its last hour of data, we were 95% done with the day&#x27;s computation work.

I have two main complaints about it:<p>1. The UX is subpar. It insists on running in only a single tab at a time, and attempts to open multiple tabs will instead override whatever it considers to be the master tab. This is a huge pain, because I often need to have a mapping workflow open in one window and some other relevant part of the application open in another. Instead I have to save, go find the thing I want, and go back. Another problem is that when working with data sources containing tons of fields, there&#x27;s no easy way to search.<p>2. It offers an expression language to perform some computational tasks, similar to what you&#x27;d find in Excel, but it&#x27;s hamstrung by a poor UI and a limited amount of functions. The built-in editor for expressions is really poor (see Tableau for an example of a great editor for a simple Excel-like language; it even has type linting) and, unless I&#x27;ve misunderstood something, you can&#x27;t declare any variables so you end up with huge nested expressions. There aren&#x27;t many functions available, so something as simple as removing whitespace ends up as lstrip(rstrip(foo)). In combination with no support for statements (or at least a let expression like in lisp) this makes any nontrivial data munging completely indecipherable.<p>I&#x27;ve looked around in this space and it seems like there are a variety of products, but the supplier of our main CRM will only support Informatica Cloud. I think that a company that can offer a product that does what you&#x27;ve said but makes a serious effort at UX could cause users to revolt and demand to use it! I know the joke is that Slack is just a pretty IRC with better UX... but that&#x27;s exactly why it has become so successful.<p>In terms of data munging, take a look at Microsoft&#x27;s Power BI. It&#x27;s visualization software but it has a nice data munging mode that, crucially, keeps track of all the changes you make and displays them in a linear format. This is great for getting a quick idea as to what was done with the data and is essential for doing reproducible data analyses. Unfortunately, Power BI also suffers from poor UX in insisting on tiny fonts and gray-on-gray palettes that are totally unreadable to anyone over 30.",

I will answer to the best of my ability, though (mostly for my sake, who knows if this will be useful):<p>Cleaning:<p>Open Refine seems to be the best product in this category.  I haven&#x27;t used anything but my own tools to do this before, so I can&#x27;t really offer any advice.<p>Warehousing:<p>My understanding is that this is just a fancy way to talk about a database with a schema designed for analytics.  There are many open source databases which do this very well, the one I use being Cassandra (and&#x2F;or KairosDB), though it is also likely the one that is hardest to use.  For a beginner, you might want to refer to this SO answer: <a href=\"http:&#x2F;&#x2F;stackoverflow.com&#x2F;questions&#x2F;8816429&#x2F;is-there-a-powerful-database-system-for-time-series-data\" rel=\"nofollow\">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;stackoverflow.com&#x2F;questions&#x2F;8816429&#x2F;is-there-a-powerf...</a><p>Data processing&#x2F;collection:<p>This is something that is incredibly dependent on the data sources, so I likely can&#x27;t tell you anything that will help.  Most of my data sources I&#x27;ve worked with have been internally sourced log files, messages from ZMQ, or CSV data - you might be working with something far different though, since there are lots of public data sets and such which are common.  Ideally, this would be integrated into the tools that you are using to clean the data, but I don&#x27;t know if that exists.<p>Handling input from many different sources at different rates is not a very hard problem to solve if your system is build correctly - you could for example run a daemon for each data source which will populate the database when there is new data available, then send a message off to the processing engine, which will integrate the data into whatever reports you are running.<p>Specifically for a use case of a hedge fund, the reports could be triggered by a message which is sent when the new data is available, and processing could be done in parallel in Lambda or similar dependent on need to get a nearly instant return, enabling nearly real-time reporting.",

I regularly work with manufacturers to reverse engineer and&#x2F;or measure molds, jigs, and fixtures for which there are no drawings available. A ROMER or FARO arm with a laser scanning head outputting its point cloud to a software like the PolyWorks suite can generate an incredibly accurate CAD model of incredibly large parts in a very short amount of time (an hour or two at worst if the mesh needs a lot of cleanup).<p>I assume that process would be easy to speed up if the requirement for absolute accuracy was removed. The 8&#x27; ROMER arm we use is accurate to ~!2 microns over its entire volume which is absolutely overkill for something intended to produce models for visual arts applications. A quick and dirty approach to generating the mesh might increase the inaccuracy by several orders of magnitude but when coke can has dimensional tolerances to the tune of tenths of a millimeter, the quick and dirty mesh will still be representative of the end product.",

The only way I remotely see that possible is essentially having a robot hand pick up the item at the entry point, hold it for the capture sequence (perhaps have a custom-designed &#x27;mount&#x27; that can allow for true 360 via a couple positions), and then drop it out the other side.<p>It&#x27;s the scale part I&#x27;m wondering about, re: one size machine fits all doesn&#x27;t seem to make sense. One machine for items under a certain dimension (e.g. &quot;hand held&quot;) then another for items where the machine has to essentially have super-powers to pick up and rotate objects to complete the imaging process (e.g. a couch, a dresser, a motorcycle, etc).

Current solutions aren&#x27;t ideal when it comes to setting up new systems as well as updating and maintaining existing systems.  We build several million dollar facilities a month and each one has automation and measurement equipment that has to be individually set up and programmed.  Each technician does things a slightly different way, and the end result is a different set of automation and measurement logic at each facility.<p>2) Fiber optic DATS (distributed acoustic and temperature sensing) data handling and interpretation.  This is a fairly new type of technology in which a fiber optic line is installed in the wellbore.  The fiber optic line basically acts as a 15,000&#x27; strand of thermometers and microphones placed every 3&#x27;. The data from one installation is on the order of terabytes per hour.  Oil and gas service companies that offer this service don&#x27;t know how to handle this amount of data.  The problem could probably be solved with S3 or something.<p>3) Drilling optimization. Create a software suite that utilizes ML&#x2F;AI to help drilling engineers figure out the best way to drill a well is. It&#x27;s a perfect ML&#x2F;AI application. Lots and lots of training data available,  easily defined input and output parameters, etc. Drilling engineering is full of hard, non-linear problems and humans are just really bad at it. The only way to be good at it is to drill lots and lots of wells and then listen to your gut.",

Most files (patches, signatures) are composed of an uncompressed header, and a brotli-compressed stream (in the reference implementation, compression format are pluggable) of other messages.<p>- The main diff method is based on rsync. It&#x27;s slightly tuned, in that: it operates over the hashes of all files (which means rename tracking is seamless - the reference implementation detects that and handles it efficiently), and it takes into account partial blocks (at the end of files, smaller than the block size)<p>- The reference implementation is quite modular Go, which is nice for portability, and, like elisee mentioned, used in production at itch.io. We assume most things are streaming (so that, for example, you can apply a patch while downloading it, no temporary writes to disk needed), we actually use a virtual file system for all downloads and updates.<p>- The reference implementation contains support for block-based (4MB default) file delivery, which is useful for a verify&#x2F;heal process (figure out which parts are missing&#x2F;have been corrupted and correct them)<p>- The wharf repo contains the basis of a second diff method, based on rsync - for a secondary patch optimization step. The bsdiff algorithm is well-commented with references to the original paper, and there&#x27;s an opt-in parallel bsdiff codepath (as in multi-core suffix sorting, not just bsdiff operating on chunks)<p>- A few other companies (including well-known gaming actors) have started reaching out &#x2F; using parts of wharf for their own usage, I&#x27;ll happily name names as soon as it&#x27;s all become more public :)<p>I&#x27;d be happy to answer any questions!",

Things like &quot;what kind of area is this property in&quot;, &quot;what are schools like&quot; &quot;what are prospects for this area 5 years down the road&quot; and so on. All this information (and MUCH more) is currently readily available online.

My wife and I scouted locations, went to open houses, did research online for things that are important to us and finally called the agent and said &quot;we want to make an offer.&quot; Other than that the only other time we called is for her to let us into a home if there was no open house soon.<p>10+ years ago we had other &quot;agents&quot; that made a lot of money, e.g. &quot;Travel Agent&quot; in Travel&amp;Leisure industry.

Also an issue with vets, hairdressers etc - pick an appointment based niche. (Have invested in 2 niches, advised others)<p>Wireless sensors for industry: Thousands of players here, including network providers and different tech stacks. The game is to find a niche that is easy to enter and pats well. (Have invested in wireless water metering, advised others)<p>Drone inspection: Plenty of players here, but it&#x27;s a find-a-niche that you can sell to play, and you need operators for each application. (Have advised drone and drone application companies)<p>Anything on a drone: Drone&#x27;s don&#x27;t last long in the sky. (as above)<p>Trains: Trains get solved at the political level. Good luck in the USA. (am train lobbyist)<p>Motorbike safety: Check out where Dainese and BMW are going - air bags et al. I spend a fortune on BMW gear. (Motorcyclist)<p>GUI HUDs: The main player failed (Skully - internal issues) . I know of at least one early stage company attempting a generic HUD solution. (have met, not invested the early stage one and decided, luckily, that I didn&#x27;t like the Skully people and did not pre-order.)<p>Motorbike storage: Has been a huge market since the 90s when you could only get adventure boxes from one supplier - in Munich. Now the problem is solved by countless suppliers and manufacturers - unless you buy a sports bike, which have a very different use-case. My first adventure trip was in 98 and I needed to self-assemble, now you can ride out of several branded dealerships with a capable round the world bike. (have motorbiked round what world - in pieces)<p>VR: The use-case is really only games so far. See Playstation. (have 2 VR kits)<p>Lighter than Air: Capacity and cost versus shipping are the issue, while air-cargo is well solved. Meanwhile the Helium market is stuffed. But I love the industry too. (read Bill Gate&#x27;s recommended book on international shipping etc.)<p>Low income cooking: Those low income people are time-poor, poorly educated (the US system is dreadful) and marketed too by monster franken-food companies that price under the cost of decent food. Yes - its a hard problem to solve. (don&#x27;t get me started)<p>Education: Indeed. Start with politics and how schools are funded.<p>Taiwan: (sadly) Why would you pay more than $1 over market?",

People are doing this but it&#x27;s taking way too long to take off for how much money is there just waiting to be picked up.<p>Sticking a laser scanner on a drone. Again, people are doing it, but what the fuck, there&#x27;s <i>so much money</i> just sitting there.<p>If you&#x27;re looking for contract work, just start browsing random EPC websites and calling up the shitty ones. Probably a good 10,000 at least that are still rocking 1995 crapsites, and not in the &quot;good&quot; &quot;low functionality low load time&quot; way, the &quot;using tables for layout&quot; way.<p>Trains should be automated. They already are in Taiwan for some lines, it&#x27;s been feasible for years.<p>Motorcycle safety is still subpar for where we are in material science. There are a lot of riders out there that will pay <i>buckets</i> for greater safety. We&#x27;ve figured out how to not get our skin ripped off but I believe there&#x27;s still a market for preventing broken bones, spinal snaps, decapitations, and the like.<p>Somehow we still don&#x27;t have GUI HUDs in our moto helmets. Like BMW is working on something but honestly it would be a <i>relatively</i> simple and profitable thing for a <i>very</i> small startup (2 man team working part time). Literally even just casting your smartphone screen to the visor would be enough to get people buying so they can have a HUD map and shit.<p>Big market for motorcycle storage solutions. I giggle whenever I see someone with an ammo box strapped onto their sports bike. We already dropped hundreds on gear and thousands on the bike, we spend many more hundreds or thousands on modding the things, there&#x27;s ample opportunity for more elegant and functional storage solutions.<p>VR allows for limitless desktop screen space in a portable package. I&#x27;d like to be able to bring an HTC vive and a tiny screenless box to plug it into that would allow me to have a &quot;multi-monitor&quot; setup while I travel. Some say the resolution isn&#x27;t there yet, I say make the text bigger. I have no problem reading the stuff in steamVR.<p>I get made fun of every time I bring it up but I&#x27;m convinced people are stupidly ignoring lighter than air travel, transportation, and data distribution, especially in an automated sense. Google has their wifi balloon thing but they dropped their blimp transport truck project. I think it could&#x27;ve been a thing.<p>There may be some margins available in teaching low-income people how to cook and eat basic foods instead of frozen meals. It took me to getting scholarshipped into college to realize that we were losing buckets of money eating frozen meals and fast food because we thought it was the &quot;cheapest option,&quot; not to mention how unhealthy we were for it. Think like somehow getting low-income folks to buy potatoes, onions, peppers, dried beans, cheap cuts of meat, etc and demonstrating how it&#x27;s faster, cheaper, healthier, etc. Potentially a gov funding opportunity, would save on EBT and healthcare costs.<p>Kids learn by doing. Good luck changing anything about education in the USA though.<p>Someone would be able to take over any industry in Taiwan that they please if they start up the company and instantly pay 2x local salary, give PTO, and have other basic benefits that we take for granted here. It wouldn&#x27;t be much, you&#x27;d be paying ~44k&#x2F;year USD for an Engineer, for example. You&#x27;d be able to poach the best talent, you&#x27;d draw shitloads of negative press from pissed of old Taiwanese businesspeople (no press is bad press), everyone would be telling you you&#x27;re wrong, and you&#x27;d Donald Trump your way straight to the top. Think Scranton Oakmont or Gordon Ramsay as well. Just don&#x27;t break the law. Also learn Chinese.",

I know hundreds of people that already know how to better manage their safety stock than someone who suggests using Gaussian demand models. I know hundreds of people who can optimize last mile delivery costs orders of magnitude better than a drone engineer. I know hundreds of people who can manage inventory distribution and ordering automation better than someone who knows databases.<p>And sure, there are companies out there that are doing everything ass backwards and could use some help, even if it is primitive and simplistic.
