This link[1] has details on the material when used with laser sintering and in regard to contact with food. The key quote is &quot;[...]are in compliance with EU Plastics Directive 2002&#x2F;72&#x2F;EC for the use with all types of foods except high alcoholic foodstuffs[...]&quot;<p>That said, there is a porosity issue with 3D printed parts and consequently dry coffee coats the impeller and sticks to the surface right away. It&#x27;s a big problem if in contact with dairy, meat, liquids, etc. because it harbors bacteria. For this reason, ShapeWays does not claim to be food-grade. I don&#x27;t think it matters for dry coffee though. Nevertheless, there&#x27;s a writeup about this on the storefront so customers can make the call if they care about stale coffee on their impeller or not.<p>[1] <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.sculpteo.com&#x2F;static&#x2F;0.30.0-49&#x2F;documents&#x2F;materials&#x2F;polyamide_PA2200&#x2F;Food%20Assessment%20PA.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.sculpteo.com&#x2F;static&#x2F;0.30.0-49&#x2F;documents&#x2F;material...</a>",

How long have you been doing this and what do you do?<p>You don&#x27;t have to answer but your questions are odd for someone with experience in the industry. But let&#x27;s get into it:<p>How is performance made public? The same way people know what &quot;stealth&quot; startups are doing. Sometimes a document leaks and sometimes people talk. Usually both. Let&#x27;s just say a manager is super secretive. Do you know how many people in the chain know performance anyway... Current and former employees. Current and former recruiters of these employees. Current and former clients. Current and former consultants to those clients. etc... And you&#x27;re saying all these people also don&#x27;t have that human urge to brag about these rock stars of the investment world? OK.<p>Even if that were the case, everyone has a cousin at State Street or HSBC, these people take coffee breaks and love to gossip performance and secrets breakdown there.<p>This is like Fermi&#x27;s paradox. If all these funds out there are beating the market, then where the hell are they??<p>All of the funds beating the market are secretive and successfully secretive? <i>For decades?</i><p>If it was as common as you imply there should be more of them known to the public by choice or by accident. That is logic.<p>Don&#x27;t be the guy who mortgages his house to buy Herbalife products and tells his wife this is your year.<p>The comment above said 99.9% are not beating the market. There are thousands of funds out there. All funds are filing Form ADV&#x27;s now...We know who exists. So yes there&#x27;s a few people who do beat the market. Those 3 Russian guys in Texas and that story about the MIT PhD&#x27;s working out of a house outside Miami and so yes, there&#x27;s a few examples out there. Dinky family offices don&#x27;t count. But no, there&#x27;s a not a bunch of professional investors with serious weight under management and outside clients beating the market over a secular horizon.<p>There&#x27;s a handful, and if you are at one of them congrats to you. But to come on a forum saying there&#x27;s a bunch of professional investors beating the market, they just all happen to super secretive billionaires and they don&#x27;t tell anyone about it. That&#x27;s misleading. That&#x27;s tech back office got your info from a e-book kinda talk. And it would be at odds with your original thesis that folks that beat the market are secretive and don&#x27;t talk. So it makes me think you don&#x27;t work at one, you just want to believe they exist. But again if you do work at one, congrats. Are you hiring?

The chances of that happening are fairly low, but still something that makes me a little uncomfortable about ESPPs.<p>Obviously your advice to max our 401k&#x2F;IRA contributions first should mitigate a lot of this, but I think it&#x27;s important to mention the risk too since there&#x27;s a certain temptation for younger engineers who think it sounds like easy money and don&#x27;t realize the full implications of it.",

I&#x27;m in The Netherlands and use DeGiro[1] which is available in France as well, so that might be an option. My investment portfolio basically consists of a few index funds, all can be bought once per month with this broker without a brokerage fee.<p>As for tax-efficient ways, my french isn&#x27;t that good so I don&#x27;t know the details but if I understand this topic [2] correctly you should have some options like PEA, PERCO&#x2F;PERP, and&#x2F;or PEE&#x2F;PEI&#x2F;PEG<p>N.B.: There will always be some discussion around this specific broker because their &#x27;default account&#x27; contains a clause where this broker is allowed to temporarily loan your assets to other customers. Don&#x27;t do this. You can get a so-called &#x27;custody account&#x27; (which is basically a regular brokerage account) that&#x27;s only marginally more expensive.<p>[1]: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.degiro.fr\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.degiro.fr</a>\n[2]: <a href=\"http:&#x2F;&#x2F;redd.it&#x2F;3oht1m&#x2F;\" rel=\"nofollow\">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;redd.it&#x2F;3oht1m&#x2F;</a>",

Just look at a long-term chart of e.g. the S&amp;P 500 at <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;finance.yahoo.com&#x2F;chart&#x2F;%5EGSPC\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;finance.yahoo.com&#x2F;chart&#x2F;%5EGSPC</a> - click &quot;Max&quot; and &quot;Settings&quot; -&gt; &quot;Logarithmic&quot; (you&#x27;ll want a logarithmic axis so that equal percent changes are equal distance on the plot). You&#x27;ll see that on average it went up over the decades, but between June &#x27;07 and February &#x27;09, it lost over 50%, and tripled since then.<p>I encourage you to read up on this, but someone else with more knowledge should recommend some books.",

People are not forced into renting. What Mr. Money Mustache is saying is &quot;Hey, don&#x27;t be the guy with the deficit, be the guy with the surplus, because everyone with the deficit will work for those with the surplus&quot;. What I hear from US with all their credit cards, it seems it&#x27;s a culture of spending way more than you earn. Spending money that you will receive at the end of the month.

Documenting your work experience is probably the most work-intensive task as they want you to lay out what you did and how it qualifies as engineering in great detail. Probably the biggest reason for my traffic is that I published my (anonymous) experience record, since real life examples of this document are nearly impossible to find on the web. For the exam, I basically studied for the better part of a week. It&#x27;s a 3 hour exam where your answers are typically paragraphs or pages long. I get the sense that some engineers struggle with it due to language issues more than anything else.",

Recently I was also contacted by someone who sells materials for the application and exam and have become an affiliate for them. It&#x27;s only been one month, but i&#x27;ve already made one referral which netted me $100. So passive income on this after hosting costs is probably $220-ish and will be more in 2017 hopefully with more affiliate sales. Obviously very small potatoes, but I never set out to make any money for this and it looks like now it will at least cover my yearly professional dues ;)<p>To be honest, the best part is the messages I get from people saying how I helped them get their license.

Since I was doing the roadmap and API design, I wanted a better understanding of ML and started digging into it.<p>For context, I started by studying the Austin tech community since that&#x27;s what I know and could manually check the conclusions.<p>The basics:<p>Overall, the system tracks 5500+ groups, conferences, etc which is close to 60k events. It grows as it discovers new groups and events via a few channels.<p>As it finds and imports groups and then events, it categorizes each based on how they&#x27;re described. If it&#x27;s from Meetup.com, the category data and topic are reasonably good so it starts with that. If the source is Eventbrite, less so. If the source is an event website, even harder.<p>After ~15 months, it&#x27;s discovered about 105k keywords&#x2F;phrases, some only barely related. Of those, only about 7500 are actually useful. Not surprisingly, they include languages, frameworks, companies, products and combinations of words. (Side note: I&#x27;ve found words like &quot;hacking&quot; are less of an indicator now than when I started.. because everyone  is &quot;hacking&quot; something.. marketing, cooking, etc.)<p>From all that, groups are qualified in&#x2F;out based on their overall score. I manually review things that are borderline but that&#x27;s 2-3 most weeks. That keyword&#x2F;phrase list also feeds into the hashtags that get used.<p>The first version of this - hardcoded, no ML - was hacked together in a day. I&#x27;ve rebuilt it from the ground up to wire in the ML processing to scale across all the cities.<p>I later did some major refactoring to have pluggable output so it can broadcast into a Slack channel (done &amp; released) and eventually send you a reminder DM or text (via Twilio!)",

We went out drinking the same day and when we came back at night we put together a watch face while still being drunk. We uploaded it, set the lowest possible price 1$, and... Nothing happened. Everywhere in the admin panel it showed 0. 0 downloads, not a single dime earned, even after a few days. We were devastated.<p>But than I found another tab in the utterly shitty admin panel and it hit me like a rock. The numbers on the dashboard were a monthly overview and in fact we earned already hundreds of dollars and downloads in just a few days. I went back to the computer, but together an even better watch face, set it to 1$ again and watched it selling like hotcakes.<p>However it tried out quite quickly after that. People started to copy stuff and giving it away for free and I never bought the watch myself, I just used the emulator to test my apps. So I took them out of the store at the end because dealing with taxes and sharing the income does not make it worth it if you get support requests like &quot;how can I change the time on my watch&quot;, &quot;what do I care, its your shitty watch and Samsung&#x27;s shitty interface&quot;...\nSo yea.

The thought was that since there was a potential merger coming up, shareholders were going to need to vote on it one way or the other. That meant that Tesla&#x27;s institutional shareholders were going to have to recall their loaned shares from short sellers because if the stock were loaned out at the vote record date then the institution technically didn&#x27;t own it and wouldn&#x27;t be able to vote on the merger. Since Tesla has such a large percentage of institutional ownership this would trigger a short squeeze.<p>For whatever reason this never materialized but I don&#x27;t know why. There&#x27;s a possibility it may have been against SEC rules or that institutions gradually recalled their shares so as not to disturb things too much.",

QQQ is on that list and it&#x27;s a NASDAQ index ETF. If you primarily own indexes though then you don&#x27;t really own shares in the individual companies comprising that index, so I don&#x27;t think you have something to loan technically. Like you might sort of own a lot of Apple through an S&amp;P index, but you can&#x27;t really deliver shares of Apple to a short seller.<p>Two columns to note in the link above:<p>* if you look at the &quot;% Float&quot; column in the link above, you can see that TSLA is at 32.0%, meaning that 32% of all TSLA stock is held by people that are shorting it. this calculation is a little more nuanced than this because shorts are only borrowing it and the stock kind of has two owners, but it paints the general picture: 1&#x2F;3 of Tesla stock holders are there because they hope Tesla stock decreases in value. I think they&#x27;re dead wrong but that&#x27;s how markets are made.<p>* the &quot;days to cover&quot; column means that if all the short sellers tried to close their position (ie, buy stock in the company), how many days would it take that to happen at an average day&#x27;s volume? this can be an indicator of companies ripe for a short squeeze, where a company announces unexpected good news and shorts rapidly try to close their position but not enough people want to sell and so the stock price skyrockets. This famously happened to Volkswagen: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.quora.com&#x2F;What-are-some-of-the-greatest-short-squeezes-ever\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.quora.com&#x2F;What-are-some-of-the-greatest-short-sq...</a><p>be aware of a few things in general:<p>* these rates are completely out of your hands. GOGO of Gogo inflight Wifi is listed at 43% float and 21 days to cover, but its borrow rates are around 8%. I don&#x27;t know why.<p>* in many cases, there is a short argument worth listening to and there&#x27;s a reason many people are shorting a stock. GoPro&#x2F;GPRO is currently paying <i>86%</i> for people to lend out their shares to short sellers. You could buy GoPro and lend out your shares but then you run the risk of owning GoPro and it&#x27;s a big question mark how big that risk is. I face that same risk in owning Tesla, but I think the short argument is garbage and I really believe in the company and that&#x27;s enough for me.<p>* the tesla situation was kind of a perfect storm because it has a lot of fervent believers on both sides. companies that people are really passionate about might be hard to come by.",

TSLA became classified as &quot;hard to borrow&quot; and borrowing premiums would be anywhere from 8% to 100+% depending on the day&#x2F;demand. this is money short sellers pay on top of the cost to purchase the shares (and one more thing to bear on top of the risk of short-selling, but that&#x27;s another story).<p>the premium is paid daily, and the brokerage usually takes a chunk of it (often half), so if you had $100k of tesla stock and the premium was 50%, you&#x27;d earn (100,000 * 50% * (1&#x2F;2) &#x2F; 365) = $68.50 for each day that someone borrowed your shares. the rate fluctuated daily, but this still netted me several thousand dollars of truly passive income, since i was planning to hold the stock either way. this is also a huge income stream for institutional shareholders that are sitting on millions of shares.",

I notice you use the Twitter widget&#x2F;embed on Grasswire. How do you like it?<p>I&#x27;ve always felt it was kind of redundant to show the same content that&#x27;s already on the site. The reason why I&#x27;m asking is because while doing my &quot;due diligence&quot; about blogging&#x2F;bloggers (our target market after the pivot), I&#x27;ve noticed that a solid 10-15% of all blogs use it (or a similar widget from Pinterest or FB). I can see how they CAN be useful, but the fact that they are mostly &quot;consumption only&quot;  and mostly curated by one person, means that there is a lot of room to improve them, which is exactly what we&#x27;re trying to do with our community platform.

It&#x27;s not trivial to do, however, while investing in the boring funds I mentioned is extremely easy for anyone with a bank account, and investing in government bonds is as easy as investing in stock. In particular, for both the funds and government bonds the tax is paid automatically, while if you invest abroad, you have to do the calculations yourself, and from what I&#x27;ve read they are not as simple. Not to mention the extra cost and risk of opening an account outside your country; for instance, the Brazilian customer protection laws won&#x27;t apply to an account outside the country, for obvious reasons. All in all, it&#x27;s a lot more research to do, with the extra risk of investing outside your home jurisdiction, for a much smaller return, and the only benefit being reducing your exposition to your own government - one I&#x27;ll be always exposed to, since I live here (it could easily impose taxes on capital held abroad, for instance).<p>&gt; But surely that&#x27;s the interest rate that their central bank charges to the banks (which influences the interest rates banks pay&#x2F;charge for savings&#x2F;loans with them), not the interest rate that they are paying on their own government bonds? I&#x27;m not an expert, but I&#x27;m pretty sure those are two very different things.<p>It&#x27;s complicated, but basically the government sets the SELIC rate target, and buys&#x2F;sells government bonds so the SELIC rate moves towards that target. The SELIC rate itself is the interest rate banks pay each other for a one-day loan with government bonds as the guarantee. Finally, one of the government bonds (the LFT) pays the principal ajusted by the SELIC rate at its term. There is also the pre-fixed government bonds (the LTN), which pays a fixed value but is bought for less, the inflation-indexed NTN-B, which I already mentioned, and a few others.<p>As for why increasing the interest rate helps control the inflation, that&#x27;s one thing I still don&#x27;t quite understand. I just know that the government does increase the interest rate when the inflation gets above the target.",

It&#x27;s not called the &quot;risk-free&quot; interest rate for nothing: it&#x27;s the lowest risk investment one can get within Brazil. Corporate bonds, for instance, will have a higher return, due to their higher risk.<p>As for inflation, when it increases the SELIC&#x2F;CDI rates tend to rise with it too. And if you&#x27;re afraid of that (it hasn&#x27;t been long since we had a hyperinflation, so a lot of people still are), another government bond (NTN-B) has a return of inflation (measured by the IPCA index) plus a pre-fixed component (currently around 6%). Due to its pre-fixed component, it has some interest rate risk (if the interest rate rises, its present value drops, and vice-versa), but that&#x27;s not a problem if you intend to keep it to term.<p>And, actually, the high interest rate is set by the government, as a way to control the inflation, so it&#x27;s not as linked to the risk of default as one might think. The government could decide to lower the interest rate (and it has: a few years ago, it was set lower, but that led to the currently higher inflation, so the government increased it again to contain the inflation).",

On the other hand, there are funds which track the USD; see for instance <a href=\"http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.bb.com.br&#x2F;docs&#x2F;pub&#x2F;siteEsp&#x2F;dtvm&#x2F;dwn&#x2F;inf04128893.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.bb.com.br&#x2F;docs&#x2F;pub&#x2F;siteEsp&#x2F;dtvm&#x2F;dwn&#x2F;inf04128893.p...</a> . That fund had a return of 150% in the last 5 years; however, it had a return of -12.58% this year. The CDI had a return of only 64% in the last 5 years, but that&#x27;s a consistent return, with no negative months. This year the CDI had a return of 12%, so if you had in January invested in a fund which tracks the CDI, you&#x27;d be way ahead of someone who invested in a fund which tracks the USD.<p>In other words: yes, investing in USD has a higher return, but that return also comes with a higher risk.

The most boring funds (the ones which track the interbank rate - CDI) easily return around 12% per year (depending on the administration fee; the smaller the administration fee, the higher the return). With the inflation around 6% per year, this gives around 6% returns before tax. If you stay with the fund for at least two years (and it&#x27;s of the correct kind), the tax rate is 15% over the gains, so you have an after-tax return of around 5% per year above inflation. And that&#x27;s for a fund which basically never gives negative returns.<p>You can go further and buy government bonds directly, through the Tesouro Direto system. Those indexed by the SELIC rate (which is sort of related to the CDI) are currently around 13.5% per year, before administration fees and taxes (in fact, the boring funds I mentioned above mostly invest in these SELIC-indexed government bonds).<p>This will change when (and if) rates get lower, but so far, investing in these funds or bonds is the simplest (and one of the best) way to have passive income.",

Thought I was clever, did the math on how much I can rent out an apt on AirBnB, and what the mortgage would be on 30 year fixed, and my calcs said I need to put only 5% down to break-even. Then I contact lender and turns out, for Investment properties, they require minimum of 25% to 35% cash as downpayment. They said this was to hedge their risks against a borrower who would bail easily if an investment property goes south.<p>Any way around this? i.e. around not having to put 25% down on investment RE?",

Optimage \u2013 276 058 bytes, ImageOptim \u2013 297 561 bytes. But this is just a lossless test.<p>&gt; Also are you going to support and fix the frequent bugs that png optimizers run into with esoteric color space&#x2F;alpha combinations beyond the best effort...?<p>At some stage, yes. Right now I&#x27;m focused on things like losslessly rotating JPEGs according to Orientation meta in Exif, adding CMYK to RGB convertion when Convert to sRGB is ON, supporting container formats like ICO and ICNS, more tweaks to compressors for performance and smaller output, GUI improvements, etc.",

To do this, I downloaded images of patents from the US Patent Office Database, paid a virtual assistant $1&#x2F;hour to clean them and standardize the proportions, then using a Photoshop Action applied in Batch, I generated all of the images. After getting all of the images, I built an online store and integrated with printing and fulfillment service using Woocommerce and a Restful API - so when orders are placed, it triggers the artwork to be printed, and shipped, automatically. I now make about $300&#x2F;month from that project and spend about 10 minutes&#x2F;week managing it.<p>Here is a link to that website:\nwww.PatentArtStore.com<p>Anyone have any suggestions for my next project?",

You avoid &quot;being forced to sell [your] time&quot; because you extract wealth from those who do.<p>Rent seeking does not, by definition, involve &quot;creating value&quot;:<p><i>In economics and in public-choice theory, rent-seeking involves seeking to increase one&#x27;s share of existing wealth without creating new wealth. Rent-seeking results in reduced economic efficiency through poor allocation of resources, reduced actual wealth creation, lost government revenue, increased income inequality, and (potentially) national decline.</i> - Wikipedia<p>From <i>Taking Back Adam Smith and \u201cClassic Liberalism\u201d</i>:<p><i>Many conservative economists claim to be staunch followers of Adam Smith.  They shout slogans such as \u201cSupply and Demand!\u201d  \u201cCapitalism\u201d! \u201c  \u201cLet the markets work!\u201d  However, for anyone who actually read Adam Smith, you would note that the \u201cinvisible hand\u201d was not his only observation of the inner workings of capitalism.  Adam Smith recognized that many in the economy were making gobs of money, but weren\u2019t contributing anything.  He was referring to what was eventually called \u201ceconomic rent\u201d.<p>Smith observed that all production required 3 things.  Land, Capital, and Labor.  A very simple example would be a brick factory.  The building and oven needed to create the bricks are the \u201ccapital\u201d \u2013 the owners are the capitalists.  The people making the bricks is the \u201clabor\u201d \u2013 the people doing the actual work.  The Land the factory occupies and the clay used to make the bricks is the \u201cland\u201d \u2013 the owners of the land are the \u201cRentiers\u201d.  Any money made by selling the bricks is then divided up between these three groups: the rentiers, the capitalists, and the workers.</i><p>Where many here on HN and I will differ is what forms of passive income are rent seeking rather value creating applications of the output of one&#x27;s previous labor.<p>Note that you can even be pro-Capitalism and anti-rent-seeking: <i>How Economists Duped Us into Attacking Capitalism Instead of Parasitic Rent-Seeking</i> <a href=\"http:&#x2F;&#x2F;evonomics.com&#x2F;economists-duped-attacking-capitalism&#x2F;\" rel=\"nofollow\">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;evonomics.com&#x2F;economists-duped-attacking-capitalism&#x2F;</a>",
